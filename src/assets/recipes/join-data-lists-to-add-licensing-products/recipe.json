  "category": "Data List",
  "DSPVersions": [],
  "overview": "A #Data List is configured to show an Account’s related Organizations on the Opportunity record page, with an action called \"Add Licensing Products.\" A second #Data List named \"Licensing Products\" lists all licensing-type products and is configured as a Joiner on the first list using the JOIN_DATA_LIST function.\n\nUsers first select multiple Organizations from the primary data list, then the Licensing Products data list opens so they can select one or more licensing products. After clicking Next, a Pre-Action screen displays the transformed target field values, allowing users to review and adjust them before execution. Finally, users click the action button to apply the change using both sets of selections.",
  "generalUseCase": "Use joined #Data Lists to build multi-step selection flows where users first choose records from one list, then from another, and run an action that uses both selections—optionally opening a Pre-Action screen so transformed values can be reviewed and edited before execution.",
