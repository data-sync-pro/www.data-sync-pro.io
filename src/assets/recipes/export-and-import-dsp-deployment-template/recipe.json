  "category": "Batch",
  "DSPVersions": [],
  "overview": "A Pipeline named “DSP Deployment Template” is exported using the Export quick action on the Pipeline record, generating a file that is then imported into another Pipeline configured with a Template Direction to apply the same configuration in a different Pipeline.",
  "generalUseCase": "Use Pipeline export to package DSP configurations into reusable deployment templates that can be shared across the community for industry solutions—for example, standardized setups for Salesforce Revenue Cloud or nCino. \n\nYou can also use it to manually move DSP configuration from one environment to another (such as DEV to QA), which is especially convenient for small teams with lighter DSP footprints that prefer manual deployments. \n\nFor more complex implementations, automated deployment using DSP Pipelines with a dedicated Direction is recommended.",
