  "title": "Skip No-Op Updates in #Batch — Contact Updates",
  "category": "Batch",
  "DSPVersions": [],
  "overview": "A Skip Update If No Changes setting is enabled in a #Batch job that updates Contact's Record Type and Email fields. During execution, DSP auto-compare each target field’s computed value with what's stored in database. If every mapped field is unchanged, DSP skips the update DML—avoiding downstream automation/validation churn and improving throughput.",
  "generalUseCase": "Prevent “no-op” writes during batch loads, synchronizations—so validations, flows, triggers, and audit fields aren’t needlessly hit, and bulk jobs run faster.",
