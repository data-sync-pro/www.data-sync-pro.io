  "category": "Trigger",
  "DSPVersions": [],
  "overview": "A #Trigger is configured on Account to automatically manage Territory-based sharing. On after insert and after update, it creates an Account Sharing record whenever the Territory Manager field is populated for the first time or updated to a new value. A separate after update #Trigger then removes the outdated Account Sharing record for the previous Territory Manager when the field changes—keeping Account access aligned with the current Territory Manager at all times.",
  "generalUseCase": "Use #Trigger to automatically create, update, or delete child records in response to key parent field changes, keeping related data consistent and reducing manual maintenance.",
