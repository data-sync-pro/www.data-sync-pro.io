  "overview": "A big object is created as a backup store for the Case object. A scheduled #Batch Executable is configured to take Case records and insert them into this big object on a recurring basis. The Executable uses Incremental Retrieve, so each run only processes Cases that have changed since the last execution—keeping the backup up to date without reprocessing all historical data.",
  "generalUseCase": "Salesforce Big Object is a cost-effective solution that can take in large volume data with great performance without moving data off-platform. Use DSP #Batch to quickly build and move data into Big Objects—for example, as a structure-based (instead of file-based) backup/archive, to store record-based (instead of field-based) change histories, to retain large amounts of historical or compliance-related data, or to capture large-volume transactional data such as Financial Account Transactions. Big Object data can then be queried in a #Data List using dynamic filters and placed on a Lightning Record Page, serving as a related data list in context.",
