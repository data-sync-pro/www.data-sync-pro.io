  "overview": "A self-adaptive #Trigger is used to enforce owner policies on Opportunity:\n- Renewal records must be owned by the Account Owner.\n- High-value opportunities (≥ $500,000) must be owned by a Sales Manager (Owner.Profile).\n```\nERROR(\"Renewal opportunities must be owned by the Account Owner.\", RecordType.DeveloperName == \"Renewal\" && OwnerId != Account.OwnerId, \"Opportunities ≥ $500,000 must be owned by a Sales Manager.\", Owner.Profile.Name != \"Sales Manager\")\n```",
  "generalUseCase": "Use the ERROR() function to define a validation rule for each field within a single self-adaptive #Trigger—centralized, streamlined, and bulk-safe with DSP expressions/formulas.",
