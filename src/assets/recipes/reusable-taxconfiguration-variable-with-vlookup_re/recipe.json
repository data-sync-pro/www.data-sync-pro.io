  "category": "Transformation",
  "DSPVersions": [],
  "overview": "A Variable named TaxConfiguration is configured using VLOOKUP_RECORD to retrieve a single TaxConfiguration__c record based on the source record’s BillingCountry. An Executable then references this Variable in its field mappings—using expressions like #TaxConfiguration.TaxRate__c, #TaxConfiguration.TaxCode__c, and #TaxConfiguration.ReportingRegion__c—so multiple tax-related fields can be populated from the same configuration record without repeating VLOOKUP expressions, keeping the mapping logic concise and easy to maintain.",
  "generalUseCase": "Use Variables to define reusable, named expressions that can be referenced across multiple Executables. \nUse VLOOKUP_RECORD inside a Variable when you need to fetch a single record once and then populate multiple target fields via #VariableName.Field, avoiding repeated VLOOKUP calls and keeping mappings concise and consistent.",
