  "category": "Trigger",
  "DSPVersions": [],
  "overview": "A #Trigger Executable is configured on Quote after insert. When a Quote is created from an Opportunity, the trigger retrieves all related OpportunityLineItem records and automatically creates corresponding QuoteLineItem records, copying key fields such as Product, Price, Quantity, Discount, and other required attributes.",
  "generalUseCase": "Use #Trigger with a Joiner to automatically create and initialize child detail records on a downstream object based on an upstream source—for example, copying line items when generating Quotes, Orders, or other transaction records—so users don’t need to recreate line details manually.",
