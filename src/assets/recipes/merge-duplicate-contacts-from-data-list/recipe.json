  "category": "Data List",
  "DSPVersions": [],
  "overview": "A #Data List is configured for guided, manual deduplication by business users. The Executable defines a Retrieve query that displays a list of Contacts, uses the Merge action with Apply Duplicate Matching enabled, and applies configurable sorting logic to choose the principal record. During merge, DSP fills in missing fields on the principal record using values from the merged records. This lets business users select records from the data list and have duplicates (identified by standard Salesforce Duplicate Management) merged automatically based on preconfigured rules with a single button click.",
  "generalUseCase": "Use #Data List to give business users a guided, click-to-merge experience for cleaning up duplicates—identified by Salesforce out-of-the-box Duplicate Management—where merges run automatically based on preconfigured principal record selection rules and other powerful options you enable.",
