  "category": "Batch",
  "DSPVersions": [],
  "overview": "A Bulk API–enabled #Batch is used to issue a blank update to Accounts, invoking the self-adaptive #Trigger (before update) to perform in-memory rollup recalculations via DSP AGG_ functions. With a Batch Size = 2000, the job scales to millions of records in minutes(TBD).",
  "generalUseCase": "Use a mass blank update via a #Batch to invoke self-adaptive #Triggers and recalculate fields in memory (e.g., rollups and other transformations) across large record sets.\n\nEnable Bulk API and set a large batch size (e.g., 2000) in #Batches to significantly boost throughput and complete millions of recalculations in minutes.",
