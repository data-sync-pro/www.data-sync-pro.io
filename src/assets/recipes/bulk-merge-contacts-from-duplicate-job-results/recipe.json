  "overview": "A #Batch is configured for large-scale deduplication of Contacts using Salesforce standard Duplicate Management. An admin first runs a Salesforce duplicate job on Contacts to generate Duplicate Record Sets and Duplicate Record Items. DSP then retrieves those Duplicate Record Sets filtered by the Duplicate Job Id and uses the related Duplicate Record Items as the target records. A principal record selection rule determines which Contact to keep, and during the merge DSP populates any missing fields on the principal Contact from the merged records—enabling massive, automated cleanup of Contact duplicates without losing important data.",
  "generalUseCase": "Use #Batch for large-scale, rules-driven deduplication on supported mergeable objects—leveraging Salesforce Duplicate Management to identify duplicates, applying configurable principal record selection rules, and automatically filling missing fields on the principal record from merged records, so you can clean up data in bulk without losing important information.",
