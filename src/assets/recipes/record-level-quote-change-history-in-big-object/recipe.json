  "category": "Trigger",
  "DSPVersions": [],
  "overview": "A big object is created to store Quote change history at the record level (instead of Salesforce’s field-level history), indexed by RecordId__c and LastModifiedDate__c. A #Trigger on Quote (after insert, after update) inserts a new record into the big object each time a Quote is created or changed. An actionable #Data List is configured to query the big object with a dynamic filter on the current Quote and includes an action that updates the original Quote with the values from the selected history record, allowing users to restore from a previous version. This data list is placed on the Quote Lightning Record Page, serving as a related history view that also supports one-click restores.",
  "generalUseCase": "Use Big Objects, #Trigger, and actionable #Data Lists to maintain record-level change history and present it directly on the source record’s page—so users can review a full timeline of past versions and selectively restore a prior state when needed, beyond standard field history tracking limits.",
