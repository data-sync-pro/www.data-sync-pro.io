  "overview": "A self-adaptive #Trigger on Account (before update) is used to perform in-memory roll-up calculations on save—no extra DML—via DSP AGG_ functions (AGG_SUM, AGG_AVG, AGG_MAX, AGG_MIN, AGG_COUNT); when related child records change (insert/update/delete/undelete), their parent Accounts are automatically queued so rollups recompute and stay current.",
  "generalUseCase": "Use a self-adaptive #Trigger (before insert, before update) to perform in-memory field calculations with DSP’s bulk-safe transformations—including roll-up summaries and other logic such as conditional assignment rules, derived fields, normalization, and defaulting—so values are computed consistently across UI, API, and data loads.",
