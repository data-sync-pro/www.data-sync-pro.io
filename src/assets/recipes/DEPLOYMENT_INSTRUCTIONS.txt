Recipe Export Update Instructions
================================
Export Date: 2025-12-19T21:43:39.352Z
Total Recipes: 1
Categories: Batch

How to Deploy the Exported Recipes:
-----------------------------------

1. Recipe Data Structure:
   - index.json: Contains recipe metadata and configuration
   - [recipe-id]/recipe.json: Individual recipe definitions
   - [recipe-id]/images/: Recipe-specific images
   - [recipe-id]/downloadExecutables/: JSON executable files

2. For Production Deployment:
   - Copy index.json to src/assets/recipes/
   - Copy all recipe folders to src/assets/recipes/
   - Ensure the directory structure matches: src/assets/recipes/[recipe-id]/

3. Recipe System Integration:
   - The index.json file is automatically loaded by RecipeService
   - Only recipes marked as "active: true" in index.json will be displayed
   - Category names are normalized to kebab-case for routing

4. Build Process:
   - Run: node src/tools/generate-recipe-components.js
   - This will generate Angular components for each recipe
   - Run: ng build
   - Test: ng serve

5. Validation:
   - All recipes in the index must have corresponding folders
   - Each recipe folder must contain a recipe.json file
   - Image references in recipes must match actual image files

- Recipe IDs are used as folder names and component identifiers
- Image paths use relative references: "images/[filename]"
- All downloadable executables are stored in downloadExecutables/ subdirectory
- Recipe categories are automatically converted to URL-friendly format
