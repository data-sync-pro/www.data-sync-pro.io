  "overview": "A #Batch is configured to restore deleted Contacts in bulk from the Salesforce Recycle Bin. The Executable retrieves soft-deleted Contact records (e.g., based on deletion date, owner, or other filters) and runs an Undelete action to bring them back as active records. ",
  "generalUseCase": "Use the Undelete action in DSP to restore soft-deleted records either in bulk with a #Batch or selectively through an interactive #Data List, so accidental deletions can be safely and easily reversed.",
