  "category": "Data Loader",
  "DSPVersions": [],
  "overview": "A #Data Loader Executable is configured to be context-aware by using $CONTEXT_RECORD_ID in its field mappings so that, when run from an Account’s Lightning Record Page, it imports Opportunity records and automatically sets AccountId to the current Account. This #Data Loader is exposed through the Opportunity #Data List on the Account page, allowing business users to upload directly from the data list—so newly loaded Opportunities are automatically related to the current Account record.",
  "generalUseCase": "Use #Data Loader with $CONTEXT_RECORD_ID to run context-aware uploads from a #Data List on any Lightning Record Page, so users can import related records directly in context and have relationships to the current record set automatically.",
