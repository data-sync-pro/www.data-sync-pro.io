<p>DSP #Trigger is a <strong>rules-driven, modular framework</strong> that simplifies Salesforce automation and validation. Instead of writing Apex or building Record-Triggered Flows, you configure Executable records that are dynamically injected into execution whenever a trigger event occurs. This approach makes automation easier to design, scale, and maintain, while ensuring all logic runs in a bulkified, governor-limit–aware manner.</p><p><strong>Key Benefits:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rules-Driven Trigger Logic</strong><br>
Define trigger rules declaratively with formulas and expressions. #Trigger logic is modular, metadata-driven, and injected dynamically at runtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bulkified by Design</strong><br>DSP automatically manages bulk processing so you can define rules as if working with a single record. You can directly reference fields on parent objects (e.g., <code>Parent__r.GrandParent__r.Field__c</code>) and use advanced functions like <code>VLOOKUP</code> or <code>AGG</code>, making even complex transformations straightforward—without writing custom SOQL or handling Apex collections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic Scoping and Criteria</strong><br>
Triggered records are evaluated against scoping rules so only the relevant subset is processed, improving efficiency and precision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexible Actions</strong><br>
Executables can perform validations, recalculate fields, insert, update, or delete related records, send notifications, publish platform events or more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Execution Order and Control</strong><br>
DSP gives administrators fine-grained control over execution order, selective bypass options, recursion handling, and user-level permissions, ensuring flexible configurations that address even complex business requirements in enterprise environments.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>By combining a <strong>rules-driven framework</strong>, <strong>bulkified execution</strong>, and <strong>metadata-driven injection</strong>, DSP #Trigger makes Salesforce automation and validation far more scalable, flexible, and maintainable, while reducing complexity and <b>significantly</b> <b>minimizing long-term technical debt</b>.</p>
