  <strong>Yes</strong>, changes made by a batch execution can be reverted
  depending on the action type and configuration. DSP provides flexible rollback
  options:
</p>
<h3><strong>For Updates</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    If <strong>Log to File</strong> is enabled, the target target data is saved
    as a JSON log file before the update. To revert updates, use
    <strong>Restore Updated From Log File</strong> quick action on the
    <b>Batch Execution</b> or <b>Execution</b> record.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>For Inserts:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Click <strong>Delete Inserted Records</strong> from the Execution record to
    delete all records inserted.
  </li>
  <li>
    To delete records from a specific batch, go to the Batch Execution record,
    open the <strong>Verify</strong> tab, select and delete target records
    directly from the data list.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>For Deletes:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use <strong>Restore From Recycle Bin</strong> if the records are still
    available in the recycle bin. This will keep the original record ID.
  </li>
  <li>
    If <strong>Log to File</strong> is enabled, use
    <strong>Re-Create Deleted From Log File</strong> on the Batch Execution to
    restore deleted data from the saved log file.
  </li>
</ul>
