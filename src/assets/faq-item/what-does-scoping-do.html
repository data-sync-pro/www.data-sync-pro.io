  <strong>Scoping </strong>refines source data in-memory using filters and joins
  to define the dataset for downstream processing. It is available in all DSP
  rules engines, including <b>#Batch</b>, <b>#Data Lists</b>, <b>#Triggers</b>, <b>#Action Buttons</b>, and
  <b>#Data Loader</b>.
</p>
<p><strong>Key functions of Scoping:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Scope Filters (in-memory filtering):</strong> Apply DSP formulas
      and expressions to define which source records proceed to Match, Mapping,
      and Action steps.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Source Joins:</strong> Combine source data with another object
      (from any Connection) or with a JSON array. DSP supports
      <strong>left joins</strong> and <strong>cross joins</strong>, enabling
      multi-source refinement and dynamic filtering.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <em>Note:</em> Scoping is for advanced data shaping that cannot be expressed
  directly in the initial SOQL query (Retrieve). It runs after data is retrieved
  or uploaded, but before Match, Mapping, and Actions.
