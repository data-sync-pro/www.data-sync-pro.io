<p><strong>#Data List</strong> goes far beyond traditional datatables. With just a SOQL query, it renders an interactive datatable with CRUD operations, inline editing, pagination, column filters, and a built-in query builder. It enables designers to <b>declaratively</b> create rules-driven transformations and actions through a guided UI. Natively integrated with Lightning App Builder, #Data List delivers fast build, rich functionality, and flexible settings for tailored data solutions.</p>
