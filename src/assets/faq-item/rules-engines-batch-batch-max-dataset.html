  DSP Batch follows the same limitations as Salesforce Apex Batch, meaning the
  maximum data size that can be retrieved in a single query is <strong>50 million</strong>

  While DSP optimizes execution for high-volume processing, the actual dataset
  size that can be processed depends on Salesforce governor limits, system
  resources, and API constraints.
