<p>Go to the <strong>Retrieve</strong> or <strong>Preview</strong> section and click a source record. This opens a detail view where you can see:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> all field values from the retrieved record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transformed:</strong> both the current values (if any) and the transformed values for mapped target fields.</p></li></ul>If the record doesn't meet execution criteria, you'll see <em>"No target action will be taken for this source record". </em>If multiple target matches exist, DSP shows them as tabsâ€”click any tab to view its transformations.<br>
