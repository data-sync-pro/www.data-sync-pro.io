<p>Data Sync Pro (DSP) provides five rules engines—each designed for a specific type of data operation—while all sharing the same record-based, declarative framework.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>#Batch</strong> – Handles large-volume processing. Replaces Apex batch jobs and enables complex transformations, data cleansing, and high-performance org-to-org migrations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>#Data List</strong> – Turns queries into interactive, configurable tables with rules-driven actions. Lets business users filter, explore, edit, and act on records at the list or row level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>#Trigger</strong> – Executes bulkified automation on DML events (insert, update, delete, undelete). Streamlines transformations, validations, and actions with rules-driven simplicity.</p></li><li><p><strong>#Action Button</strong> – Adds configurable buttons in the Lightning UI for guided record-level or global actions. Supports pre-populated transformations and workflows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>#Data Loader</b> – Enables reusable CSV imports with transformation logic. Delivers secure, auditable, and scalable data loading across Salesforce orgs.</p></li>
</ul><p>Together, these engines form DSP's unified rules platform—modular, flexible, and enterprise-grade, with declarative simplicity at its core.</p>
