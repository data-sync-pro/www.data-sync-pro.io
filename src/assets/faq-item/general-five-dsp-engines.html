  Data Sync Pro (DSP) includes five distinct rules engines—each purpose-built
  for a different type of data operation—yet all sharing a common record-based
  configuration model.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>#Batch</strong><br />
  Optimized for large-volume processing. Replaces Apex batch jobs, supports
  complex transformations, data cleansing, and high-performance migrations
  between Salesforce orgs.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>#Data List</strong><br />
  Turns query results into interactive, configurable tables. Business users can
  filter, explore, edit, and act on records with list-level or row-level
  interactions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>#Triggers</strong><br />
  Runs automation in real time based on DML events (insert, update, delete,
  undelete). Ideal for immediate transformations, validations, and actions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>#Action Button</strong><br />
  Adds configurable buttons in the Lightning UI for guided record-level or
  global actions. Supports pre-populated transformations, validations, and
  updates.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  <strong>#Data Loader</strong><br />
  Automates CSV uploads with reusable logic for transformation and validation.
  Provides secure, trackable imports into any connected Salesforce org.
