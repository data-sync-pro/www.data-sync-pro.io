      In Data Sync Pro (DSP), the five
      rules engines are distinct data processing frameworks
      built on a <strong>record-based configuration model</strong>, each
      tailored for specific types of data operations‚Äîwithin or across Salesforce
      orgs.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ Batch</h3>
    <p>
      Processes <strong>large volumes of data</strong> with
      unmatched performance enhancement. Ideal for replacing
    <strong>Apex batch jobs</strong>, performing data transformations at <strong>scale, data cleansing,
      and migrating records</strong> between Salesforce orgs.
    </p>
    <h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ Data List</h3>
    <p>
      Renders query results as
      <strong>interactive, configurable tables</strong>. Enables business users
      to filter, explore, edit, and take action on records through
      <strong>list-level or row-level interactions</strong>.
    </p>
    <h3>3Ô∏è‚É£ Triggers</h3>
    <p>
      Executes rule-based automation in response to Salesforce
      <strong>DML events</strong> such as
      <strong>insert, update, delete, and undelete</strong>. Useful for
      <strong>real-time validations, transformations, and actions</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>4Ô∏è‚É£ Action Button</h3>
    <p>
      Adds configurable buttons to the <strong>Lightning UI</strong> to initiate
      <strong>record-level or global actions</strong>. Supports
      <strong>pre-populated transformations, validations, and updates</strong>
      through guided interaction.
    </p>

    <h3>5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loader</h3>
    <p>
      Automates data uploads via <strong>CSV files</strong> using
      <strong>reusable configuration and transformation logic</strong>. Supports
      secure, trackable loading into any connected Salesforce
      org.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>üìå All five rules engines share a unified architecture:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Configured through <strong>Executable records</strong></li>
      <li>
        Follow guided steps‚Äî<strong>Input</strong>, <strong>Preview</strong>,
        <strong>Retrieve</strong>, <strong>Scoping</strong>,
        <strong>Match</strong>, <strong>Mapping</strong>,
        <strong>Action</strong>, <strong>Verify</strong>
        <em>(as applicable)</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        Fully support <strong>cross-org operations</strong> via Connections
      </li>
      <li>
        Offer <strong>granular permissions control</strong> to manage
        visibility, access, and execution
      </li>
      <li>
        Built with <strong>Salesforce-native</strong> technologies (Apex,
        Lightning Web Components), ensuring <strong>secure, performant,
        and fully integrated automation</strong> inside Salesforce
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Together, these rules engines power DSP‚Äôs unified automation
      platform‚Äîenabling teams to design modular, flexible, and enterprise-grade
      data processes without the need for code.
