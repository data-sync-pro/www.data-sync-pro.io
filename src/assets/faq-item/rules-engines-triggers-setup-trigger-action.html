    <strong>Create an Executable</strong> from a <strong>Direction</strong> or
    <strong>Pipeline</strong> with a <strong>Template Direction</strong>, ensuring that the
    <strong>Source connection</strong> is set to the <strong>current org</strong>. Select the
    <strong>triggering object</strong> as the <strong>source object</strong> and choose the
    appropriate target object. Define any <strong>matching fields</strong>, select the
    <strong>action type</strong>, and click <strong>Save</strong> to create the Executable.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Next, enable the triggering events that will execute the action, then configure the Scoping,
    Match, Mapping, and Action sections as needed.

    <em>Note</em>: Ensure that <code>pushtopics.TriggerServices.execute();</code>
    is included in your Apex Trigger with all required trigger events to enable execution.
