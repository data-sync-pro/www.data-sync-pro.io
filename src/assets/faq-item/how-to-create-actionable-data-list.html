<p>
  An <strong>Actionable</strong> <strong>#Data List</strong> is created as an
  <strong>Executable</strong> associated with a Direction. You can create one by
  clicking <strong>New Executable</strong> from:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A <strong>Direction</strong> record, or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A <strong>Pipeline</strong> with a
      <strong>Template Direction</strong> specified
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once created, DSP provides a guided interface (<b>Retrieve</b>, <b>Scope</b>, <b>Match</b>,
  <b>Mapping</b>, <b>Action</b>, <b>Verify</b>, and additional Data List settings) to configure the
  Data List into a fully interactive, reusable datatable.
