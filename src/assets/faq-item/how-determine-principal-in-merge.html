<p>
  In Merge operations, DSP applies the
  <strong>Principal Matched Record Selection Rule</strong> to decide which
  record becomes the principal (master). This record is retained after the
  merge, while the others are marked for deletion.
</p>
<p><strong>Available selection rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Most Complete</strong> – keeps the record with the most populated
      fields.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Most Child Records</strong> – keeps the record with the most
      related child records (requires specifying the child relationship name in
      <em>Principal Selection Child Relationship</em>).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Most Recently Modified</strong> – keeps the record with the latest
      <code>LastModifiedDate</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>First Record</strong> – keeps the first record according to
      a custom sort defined in
      <em>Matched Records Sorting Components</em> (using DSP formulas).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When using DuplicateRecordItem as the matching object,:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      By default, the principal is chosen at the
      <strong>DuplicateRecordItem</strong> level.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You can instead select the principal on the underlying object (e.g.,
      Account, Lead) by specifying its API name in
      <em><b>Duplicate Record Object API Name</b></em
      >.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
