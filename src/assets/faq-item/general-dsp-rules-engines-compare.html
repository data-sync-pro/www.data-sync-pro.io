<p>All DSP rules engines share a structured process for automation and transformation, but they differ mainly in how they take input:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>#Batch</strong> â€“ Runs on records retrieved by a query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>#Data List</strong> â€“ Shows query results to users, who can then select which records to act on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>#Trigger</strong> â€“ Fire automatically when Salesforce DML events occur (insert, update, delete, undelete) on the source object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>#Action Button</strong> â€“</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Connection-based</em>: Runs as a global action with no input data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Direction-based</em>: Uses the current record from a Lightning page as input.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>#Data Loader</strong> â€“ Similar to #Batch, but takes input from an uploaded CSV instead of a query.</p></li>
</ul><p>ðŸ‘‰ <strong>In short:</strong> All DSP rules engines orchestrate data in the same wayâ€”by defining an input, applying logic, and performing an action on the target. What differs is how they receive their input: #<strong>Batch, #Data List, and #Trigger</strong> use a source object; #<strong>Data Loader</strong> uses a CSV file; and #<strong>Action Button</strong> can be configured to use either no input (global) or the current record (direction-based).</p>
