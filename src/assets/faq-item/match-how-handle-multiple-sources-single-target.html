<p>
  DSP processes the target record iteratively for each matching source record.
  Each source record applies its transformations in turn, with later updates
  overwriting earlier ones. The result is a single final version of the target
  record before execution.
</p>

<p>
  To process only one source record per matched target, use the
  <code>IS_FIRST_IN_ITERATION(...expressions)</code> function in a Scope Filter.
  This ensures that only the first source record in each group is applied.
