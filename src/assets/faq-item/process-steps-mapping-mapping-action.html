<p><strong>Mapping</strong> defines how target fields are calculated before execution. It acts as the transformation layer that drives data accuracy, consistency, and quality. With a guided interface and extensive function library, designers can configure powerful transformations with ease.</p><p><strong>Key Capabilities:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Formula-Based Transformations:</strong> Apply formulas from DSP’s rich function library, referencing source fields (including relational fields), static values, Variables (reusable formulas), and optional custom Apex classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Relationships:</strong> Seamlessly handle External IDs, <code>VLOOKUP</code>s, and Record Type names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Autocomplete & Validation:</strong> Get real-time hints and formula validation on save for accuracy.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Automatic bulkification:</strong> Define mappings as if for one record—DSP automatically bulkifies the logic for optimized performance.</p></li></ul>
