    <strong>Mapping</strong> in Data Sync Pro (DSP) defines how values are assigned to target fields
    before execution. Through an intuitive, no-code interface, users can apply
    <strong>powerful, formula-based transformations</strong> to clean, enrich, and structure data at
    scale—ensuring accuracy and consistency across operations.

  <h3><strong>Key Capabilities:</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Powerful &amp; Bulkified Transformation</strong><br />
      Apply bulkified formulas using DSP’s <strong>rich function library</strong> with support for
      referencing <strong>source fields</strong> (including relational fields),
      <strong>static values</strong>, <strong>Variables</strong> (reusable formula definitions), and
      optional <strong>custom Apex classes</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Relationship-Aware Assignments</strong><br />
      Easily handle data relationships with support for
      <strong>Record Type mapping via Developer Name</strong>,
      <strong>External ID references</strong>, and <strong>VLOOKUP-based lookups</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Autocomplete &amp; Validation</strong><br />
      Benefit from <strong>real-time autocomplete hints</strong> and
      <strong>formula validation on save</strong>, improving accuracy and ease of use.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Single-Record Simplicity, Bulk Execution</strong><br />
      Define mappings as if configuring a single record—
      <strong>DSP automatically applies them at scale</strong>, handling large volumes with
      optimized, bulkified execution.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Mapping provides a scalable, low-code transformation layer that balances power, flexibility, and
    simplicity—enabling precise control over how data is prepared before it reaches its destination.
