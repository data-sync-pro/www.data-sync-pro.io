      Mapping in Data Sync Pro (DSP) defines how values 
      are assigned to target fields before execution. Through an <strong>intuitive</strong>, 
      <strong>no-code interface</strong>, users can apply powerful, formula-based 
      transformations to clean, enrich, and structure data at 
      scale—ensuring accuracy and consistency across operations.

    <h3><strong>Key Capabilities:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Powerful &amp; Bulkified Transformation</strong><br />
        Apply bulkified formulas using DSP's <strong>rich function library</strong> 
        with support for referencing source fields (including 
        relational fields), static values, Variables
        (reusable formula definitions), and optional custom Apex classes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Relationship-Aware Assignments</strong><br />
        Easily handle data relationships with support for Record Type 
        mapping via Developer Name, External ID references, 
        and VLOOKUP-based lookups.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Autocomplete &amp; Validation</strong><br />
        Benefit from real-time autocomplete hints and 
        formula validation on save, improving accuracy and ease of use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Single-Record Simplicity, Bulk Execution</strong><br />
        Define mappings as if configuring a single record—
        DSP automatically applies them at scale, handling large 
        volumes with optimized, bulkified execution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Mapping provides a scalable, low-code transformation layer that 
      <strong>balances power</strong>, <strong>flexibility</strong>, and <strong>simplicity</strong>—enabling precise
       control over how data is prepared before it reaches its destination.
