<p>Serial mode processes records sequentially instead of in parallel. This reduces the risk of <strong>row locking issues</strong>(Salesforce <code>UNABLE_TO_LOCK_ROW</code> errors), preserves execution order, and ensures safer handling of dependent transactionsâ€”for example, when multiple records update the same parent or when later actions rely on earlier updates.</p><p>The trade-off is slower performance compared to parallel execution. For most cases, parallel mode is faster, but serial mode is recommended when <strong>avoiding row locking or maintaining dependency order is more important than speed.</strong></p>
