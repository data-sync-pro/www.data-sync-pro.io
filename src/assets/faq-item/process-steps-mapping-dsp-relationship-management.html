      When maintaining data relationships for reference fields in DSP:
      <ul>
        <li>If you know the <strong>record ID</strong>, assign it directly.</li>
        <li>For <strong>Record Types</strong>, you can assign the <strong>Developer Name</strong> instead of the ID.</li>
        <li>
          For referenced objects with External ID fields, select the Referenced 
          Object and the corresponding External ID field, then map the <strong>External 
          ID</strong> value in the <strong>field's mapping</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Alternatively, use the <code>VLOOKUP</code> function to find the record 
          ID based on field matching. DSP supports multiple field matching within 
          <code>VLOOKUP</code> functions for enhanced flexibility.
        </li>
      </ul>
