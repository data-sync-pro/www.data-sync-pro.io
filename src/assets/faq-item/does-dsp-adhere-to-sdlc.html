<p>Yes. Data Sync Pro supports SDLC-aligned deployments through two options:</p>
<p>
  1️⃣ <strong>Manual JSON Export & Import (Best for SMBs)</strong><br />
  Executables can be exported from a Pipeline as a JSON file and imported into
  another org. This simple method works well for smaller teams with limited
  Connections.
</p>
<p>
  2️⃣
  <strong>Automated Deployment with DSP Migration (Best for Enterprises)</strong
  ><br />DSP can deploy any record-based configurations—including its own.
  Executable templates can be downloaded and uploaded into a Pipeline; during
  the upload, the Pipeline’s Template Direction determines the direction for the
  uploaded Executables.
