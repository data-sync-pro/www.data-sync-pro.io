      Both <strong>Preview</strong> and <strong>Retrieve</strong> define 
      queries to the source object and allow users to view source data 
      and transformed values for a record.

      <li>
        <strong>Retrieve</strong> is used in <strong>Batch</strong> and 
        <strong>Data List</strong>, where its filters and ordering clauses 
        are integral to the execution process. In <strong>Batch</strong>, 
        it defines the source data for processing, while in 
        <strong>Data List</strong>, it determines the records displayed 
        to end users.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Preview</strong> is available in <strong>Action Button</strong> 
        and <strong>Triggers</strong> but is only used for reviewing source 
        data and transformations for a specific recordâ€”it does not 
        influence execution.
