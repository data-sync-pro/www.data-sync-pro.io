<p>
    A <strong>Self-Adaptive Trigger</strong> transforms fields in a
    <strong>before insert</strong> or <strong>before update</strong> trigger
    using declarative formulas. A blank update batch retrieves records that need
    updating and performs an update operation without modifying any fields.
    During this update, the self-adaptive trigger
    <strong>re-evaluates all fields</strong> based on the defined transformation
    logic.
  </p>
  
  <p>Pairing a blank update batch with a self-adaptive trigger provides several advantages:</p><ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Reusable & Universal Automation</strong> – The
      self-adaptive trigger runs automatically regardless of whether the update
      is triggered by a batch job, web service, Apex, or manual update, ensuring
      consistency.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Performance Optimization</strong> – When the blank update
      batch is executed with <em>Bulk API</em> enabled (batch size: 2,000), the
      calculations run significantly faster than traditional Apex batch jobs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Modular & Decoupled System</strong> – Keeping batch
      execution and automation separate for easier maintenance.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example, you can create a Self-Adaptive Trigger to calculate roll-up summaries, then run a blank update batch with Bulk API (batch size: 2,000) to trigger those calculations in bulk.</p>
