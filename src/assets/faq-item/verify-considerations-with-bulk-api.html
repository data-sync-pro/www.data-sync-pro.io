    <p>
      <strong>Verify</strong> may not function properly when 
      <strong>Bulk API is enabled</strong> and <strong>target record IDs 
      are not captured</strong> in the Batch Execution log. This commonly occurs with 
      <strong>Insert</strong> or <strong>Upsert</strong> actions, where DSP 
      submits the job asynchronously and the record IDs are not immediately returned.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      However, for actions like <strong>Update</strong>, where target record 
      IDs are known before submission, <strong>Verify </strong>will continue 
      to work as expected.
