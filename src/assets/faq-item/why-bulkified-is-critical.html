<p>Bulkified transformation is essential in any enterprise data platform because it ensures that rules defined for a single record can scale seamlessly across thousands or millions of records. Without bulkification, developers must manually write queries, maps, and loops, which increases complexity, cost, and fragility.</p><p>DSP takes this further by bulkifying <strong>all functions, expressions, and relational field references</strong> automatically. You define logic as if working with one record, and DSP handles the queries, collections, and iterations behind the scenes.</p><p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Rules are defined declaratively without technical overhead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> Optimized queries reduce system load.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Less Tech Debt:</strong> No custom cumbersome bulkification code to maintain, leading to <b>significantly</b> lower long-term complexity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ðŸ“Œ <strong>In short:</strong> Bulkified transformation is critical for scalable data managementâ€”and DSP makes it effortless, delivering simplicity, efficiency, and maintainability at scale.</p>
