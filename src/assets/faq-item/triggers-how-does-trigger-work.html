  #Trigger is a <strong>bulkified, </strong
  ><strong>rules-driven, modular </strong>engine that simplifies Salesforce
  trigger logic. Instead of writing boilerplate bulkification code, you
  configure #Trigger Executable records <b>declaratively </b>that run on trigger
  events (like <em>Before Insert</em> or <em>After Update</em>).
</p>
<p>It works in two main ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Self-Adaptive Triggers</strong> – apply rules to transform or
      validate fields on the same record before it's saved.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Trigger Actions</strong> – apply rules that use the triggering
      records to insert, update or delete related records, or send notifications
      etc.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  When a trigger event occurs, DSP evaluates the
  <strong>scoping criteria</strong> to determine which records should be
  processed. It then applies field transformations, validations, or actions in a
  <strong>bulkified manner</strong> for optimal performance.
</p>
<p>
  To enable it, simply add a single line of static code to your object's Apex
  Trigger, ensuring all trigger events are included:
</p>
<pre><div><div><code>pushtopics.TriggerServices.execute();
</code></div></div></pre>
<p>
  By defining trigger logic as Executables and injecting them dynamically at
  runtime, the #Trigger rules engine acts like
  <strong>metadata-driven dependency injection</strong> for Salesforce
  triggers—making automation simpler, modular, and bulk-safe without custom
  Apex.
