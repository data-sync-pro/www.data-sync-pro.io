<p><b>Writeback</b> updates the source record after its related target records are successfully actioned. This is useful for tracking, marking completion, and preventing duplicate processing.</p><p>When a <strong>Source Writeback Field</strong> is configured, DSP supports:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Target Record ID(s):</strong> Writes a comma-separated list of successfully processed target record IDs back to the source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Static Value (TRUE or FALSE):</strong> Writes either <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> to the specified source field.</p></li></ul>
