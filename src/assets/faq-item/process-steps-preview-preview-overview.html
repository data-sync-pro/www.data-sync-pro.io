<p><strong>Preview</strong> works similarly to <strong>Retrieve</strong>, since both run a SOQL query to fetch source data. The difference lies in their purpose across rules engines:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Retrieve</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In #Batch: defines and filters source data during execution, determining which records are processed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In #Data List: defines the query used to display records.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Preview</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In #Triggers: input data comes from the trigger context (records being inserted, updated, or deleted).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In #Action Buttons: input data comes from the loaded record in the Lightning Record Page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preview does not influence which records are processed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>Both Retrieve and Preview let you view source records and inspect transformed values before executionâ€”making it easier to validate queries, data, and transformations.</p>
