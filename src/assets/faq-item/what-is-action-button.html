  An <strong>#Action Button</strong> is a rules-driven Executable that lets
  users trigger transformations and business actions with a single click. It can
  be placed as a Quick Action or surfaced as a group of LWC buttons in Lightning
  App Builder. More than just basic actions, #Action Button supports
  configurable logic, powerful transformations, versatile actions, and optional
  review of target values before execution. With native Lightning integration,
  they provide fast setup, flexible configuration, and streamlined automation
  directly within user workflows.
