  Data Sync Pro is licensed on a site-wide basis, allowing unlimited users
  within your Salesforce org,&nbsp;maximizing value across teams without
  incurring per-user (per-seat) costs.
</p>
<p>Pricing is based on three factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Connections</strong> – Each Salesforce org connected through DSP,
      including your current and any external orgs.<br />
      <em>$600 per connection per month</em>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Executables</strong> – The rules or logic units created in DSP to
      define data operations.<br />
      <em>$10 per executable per month</em>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Daily Data Volume</strong> – The total number of records processed
      each day:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>20k records/day → <em>Included</em></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1M records/day → <em>$2,000/month</em></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Salesforce platform limit → <em>$5,000/month</em></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
  This model ensures pricing scales with the scope of your data management—based
  on how many orgs are connected, how much logic you configure, and how much
  data you process.
