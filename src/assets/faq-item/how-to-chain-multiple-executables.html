<p>Use a <strong>Pipeline</strong> to organize Batch Executables and assign each one a <strong>Seq No.</strong> according to its dependency order. When the Pipeline runs, the Executables are executed sequentially, following the defined order.</p><p>You can also chain <strong>Pipelines</strong> together in scheduled jobs using the <strong>Chained Pipeline (Scheduled)</strong> field. This allows each Pipeline to remain self-contained while still being linked into larger, orchestrated workflows during scheduled execution.</p>
