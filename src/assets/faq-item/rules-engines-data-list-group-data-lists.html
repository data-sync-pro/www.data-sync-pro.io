    Grouping <strong>Executable</strong> <strong>#Data Lists</strong> into a <strong>Pipeline</strong> offers
    several key benefits:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Organized UI with Variant Options</strong><br />
      The Pipeline Data Lists component can be placed on a
      Lightning page to display multiple Data Lists using different
      <strong>variants</strong>—including <strong>stack</strong>,
      <strong>tabs</strong>, and <strong>list-views</strong>—giving designers
      control over how data is presented and navigated.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Flexible Configuration &amp; Maintenance</strong><br />
      You can <strong>add</strong>, <strong>remove</strong>, <strong>reorder</strong>, 
      or <strong>modify</strong> Executable Data
      Lists <strong>directly</strong> within the Pipeline—without changing the Lightning
      page—<strong>making updates easier to manage</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Merged Actions for Shared Queries</strong><br />
      If multiple Data Lists in the Pipeline use the same
      source query, their actions are automatically
      merged into a single list, providing users with a <strong>unified
      interface</strong>.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Pipelines bring <strong>structure</strong>, <strong>flexibility</strong>, and <strong>modularity</strong>—making it easier
    to manage and present multiple related Data Lists in one place.
