    Grouping Executable Data Lists into a <strong>Pipeline</strong> offers several key benefits:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Organized UI with Variant Options</strong><br />
      The <strong>Pipeline Data Lists</strong> component can be placed on a Lightning page to
      display multiple Data Lists using different <strong>variants</strong>—including
      <strong>stack</strong>, <strong>tabs</strong>, and <strong>list-views</strong>—giving
      designers control over how data is presented and navigated.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Flexible Configuration &amp; Maintenance</strong><br />
      You can <strong>add, remove, reorder, or modify</strong> Executable Data Lists directly within
      the Pipeline—without changing the Lightning page—making updates easier to manage.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Merged Actions for Shared Queries</strong><br />
      If multiple Data Lists in the Pipeline use the same
      <strong>source query</strong>, their actions are automatically
      <strong>merged into a single list</strong>, providing users with a unified interface.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Pipelines bring structure, flexibility, and modularity—making it easier to manage and present
    multiple related Data Lists in one place.
