<p>Serial mode processes records sequentially rather than in parallel. This reduces the likelihood of record locking issues, maintains the correct order of execution, and ensures safer handling of dependent transactionsâ€”for example, when multiple records update the same parent record or when later actions rely on earlier updates. The trade-off is slower performance, as processing takes longer compared to parallel execution. For most use cases, parallel mode is faster, but enabling serial mode is recommended selectively when data integrity or dependency order outweighs speed.</p>
