This links the List Action to the Executable that defines your Data Loader, allowing users to run the load directly from the Data List.</p><p>When the #Data Loader is placed on a Lightning record page, you can also use <strong><code>$CONTEXT_RECORD_ID</code></strong> in the field mappings. This ensures the uploaded data relates directly to the record where the #Data Loader is invoked, enabling contextual and seamless data loading.</p>
