<p>Data Sync Pro includes three user personas, each defined by a dedicated permission set to control access and actions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro Starter</strong> – Minimal access to packaged code and objects. With additional read access to Executable records, users can run those rules except for executing batches.</p></li><li><p><strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro App User</strong> – Can run asynchronous rules (e.g., Batch jobs, Data Loaders) if granted explicit access to the relevant Executable records.</p></li><li><p><strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro Administrator</strong> – Full administrative control, including access to all configuration records.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>These personas provide <strong>secure, scalable, and role-appropriate access</strong> for different types of DSP users.</p>
