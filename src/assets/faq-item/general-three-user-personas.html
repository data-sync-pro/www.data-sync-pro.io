    Data Sync Pro supports three core user personas, each defined by a dedicated permission set that
    controls access to DSP features and actions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro Starter</strong><br />
      Provides minimal access to DSP package objects and components. Users with this permission set
      can execute <strong>synchronous rules</strong> like Triggers, Record Actions, and Data
      Listsâ€”only if <strong>Read access</strong> to the associated Executable records is shared with
      them. They <strong>cannot</strong> execute Batch Jobs or Data Loaders, even if they have
      access to the related Executable records.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro App User</strong><br />
      Builds on the Starter persona by granting access to the Data Sync Pro app, as well as the
      ability to execute <strong>Batch Jobs</strong> and <strong>Data Loaders</strong>, provided the
      user has at least <strong>Read access</strong> to the relevant Executable records through
      sharing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro Administrator</strong><br />
      Grants full administrative access, including <strong>"Modify All"</strong> on all DSP objects
      and access to <strong>all custom permissions</strong> within the package. This persona is
      intended for users responsible for configuring and managing DSP across the org.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These permission sets enable <strong>secure, scalable</strong>, and
    <strong>role-appropriate access control</strong> throughout your use of Data Sync Pro.
