<p>You can simplify a complex <b>#Batch</b> job by splitting it into smaller, modular components using these approaches:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Use Multiple Executables within a Pipeline</strong><br>Divide the batch logic across multiple Executables, each handling a specific step, and group them within a Pipeline. Since batching in DSP is fast and most of the performance cost comes from DML operations, this approach ensures efficiency without significant overhead, even when breaking a large job into smaller parts.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Leverage Triggers for Sequential Actions</strong><br>If multiple actions can be initiated by a single DML on a primary object, use <strong>DSP #Triggers</strong> to orchestrate the sequence.<br>
<em>Example: updating a primary object to kick off a chain of automations sequentially.</em></li>
  </ul>

  <p>This modular strategy improves clarity, supports reusability, simplifies testing, and makes ongoing maintenance more scalable.</p>
