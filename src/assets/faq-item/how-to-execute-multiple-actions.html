  An <b>#Action Button</b> by itself runs a single configured action
  flow. To execute multiple actions in sequence, you can set it to update a
  record that meets the scope of a #Trigger. When the Trigger fires, it can
  launch additional downstream actions—such as record updates, notifications,
  emails, lead conversions, or other business processes—allowing a single button
  click to drive a full series of steps.
