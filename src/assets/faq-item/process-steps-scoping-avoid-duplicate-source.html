    To avoid duplicate source records based on specific conditions, use the
    <code>IS_FIRST_IN_ITERATION(...expressions)</code> function in a <strong>Scope Filter</strong>.
    It evaluates whether a particular combination of field values appears for the
    <strong>first time</strong>
    during the current execution cycle and excludes any duplicates that follow.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Example Usage</strong></p>
  <p>
    To process only one record per unique combination of
    <strong>FirstName, LastName, and Email</strong>:<br />
    <code>IS_FIRST_IN_ITERATION(FirstName, LastName, Email)</code>
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>
  <p>
    This filter works <strong>within each batch or CSV upload</strong>, not across the entire job.
    For better control, <strong>sort the source data</strong> so that records with the same key
    fields appear together.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Use <code>IS_FIRST_IN_ITERATION</code> to efficiently handle deduplicationâ€”without
    pre-processing or complex logic.
