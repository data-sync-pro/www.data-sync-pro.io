<p><strong>#Batch</strong> is engineered for high performance and consistently outpaces standard Apex batch jobs. Actual speed depends on factors like org resources and enabled automations, but as a benchmark: with Bulk API enabled, batch size set to 2,000, and automations bypassed, DSP can roll up 1 million Accounts from 9 million child records (across 3 objects) in ~8 minutesâ€”demonstrating enterprise-grade throughput.</p><p>Advanced features like <strong>Incremental Retrieval</strong> and <strong>Delta Update</strong> further boost efficiency, enabling DSP Batch to handle massive datasets with exceptional speed and reliability.</p>
