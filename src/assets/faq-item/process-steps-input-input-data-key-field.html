      The <strong>"Input Data Key Field"</strong> is the <strong>unique identifier</strong> for each 
      source record (case-sensitive) in DSP Data Loader. It is used 
      internally for processing, logging, and maintaining record 
      references throughout execution.

      If not specified, DSP defaults to using the <strong>row index</strong> as the <strong>Input 
      Data Key</strong>. However, defining a key field is recommended whenever 
      possible to enhance data integrity and tracking.
