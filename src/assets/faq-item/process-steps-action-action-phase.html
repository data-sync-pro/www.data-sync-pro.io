      The <strong>Action</strong> step in Data Sync Pro (DSP) defines how 
      processed data is applied to the target object. It comes after Scoping, 
      Match, and Mapping, and determines what operation is performed on each 
      target record.

    <h3><strong>Key Capabilities of Action:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Perform Target Operations</strong><br />
        Supports standard DML actions like <strong>Insert, Update, Upsert, 
        Delete, Undelete, Merge</strong>, as well as extended operations 
        such as <strong>Lead Conversion</strong>, <strong>Send Email</strong>, 
        <strong>Bell Notification</strong>, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Execution Behavior Controls</strong><br />
        Fine-tune how each record is processed using configurable options:<br />
        <ul>
          <li><em>Skip Record Update If No Changes</em></li>
          <li><em>Skip Fields If Target Value Exists</em></li>
          <li><em>Skip Null Value Fields</em></li>
          <li><em>Bypass Duplicate Rule Alerts</em></li>
          <li><em>All or Nothing DML Execution</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Writeback Options</strong><br />
        Allows writing specific values back to the source or logging them for 
        reference after successful execution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ðŸ“Œ The Action step is where all prior logic comes togetherâ€”executing the 
      intended operation in a structured, rule-driven, and efficient way.
