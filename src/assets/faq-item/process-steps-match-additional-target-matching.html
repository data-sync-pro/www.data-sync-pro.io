<p>The <strong>Additional Target Matching Criteria</strong> field lets you append extra SOQL conditions—such as filters or <code>ORDER BY</code> clauses—to the query DSP uses for matching target records.</p><p>This enables:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>More precise matching</strong> by narrowing down candidate target records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Controlled sorting</strong> of matches, especially when combined with the Principal Matched Record Selection Rule.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Use this field to fine-tune how DSP identifies and prioritizes target records during the Match step.</p>
