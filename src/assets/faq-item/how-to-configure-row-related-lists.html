<p>To display related lists for each row in a <strong>#Data List</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Create a <strong>Pipeline</strong> containing one or more #Data Lists, each
    configured with dynamic filters based on a Context Record ID.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the parent Data List Executable, set
    <strong
      ><span
        class="clickable-image"
        data-src="assets/image/data-list-how-to-configure-row-related-lists/data-list-how-to-configure-row-related-lists1.jpg"
        >Row's Related Lists Pipeline API Name</span
      ></strong
    >
    to the API Name of the Pipeline created in Step 1.

  Once configured, a standard "Related Lists" row action automatically appears
  for each row. Clicking it displays the related lists defined in the
  Pipeline.<br />
