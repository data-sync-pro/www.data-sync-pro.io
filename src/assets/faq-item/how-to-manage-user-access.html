<p>In DSP, #Trigger access is controlled through <b>Executables</b> and <b>permissions</b>. You can manage it in the following ways:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Permission Set</strong> – Assign the <strong>“DSP: Data Sync Pro Starter”</strong> permission set to all internal users. This provides the essential minimum access needed to work with #Trigger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Executable Access</strong> – When a trigger event is enabled, DSP automatically checks <strong>“All Internal Users Have Read Access?”</strong> and creates a sharing record giving all internal users read access to the Executable. You can uncheck this at any time to revoke access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bypass Permissions</strong> – Use <strong>“Bypass Triggers Custom Permissions”</strong> to let certain users (e.g., data migration users) skip trigger execution if they hold a defined permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Required Permissions</strong> – Use <strong>“Required Custom Permissions to Execute”</strong> to restrict execution so only users with specific custom permissions can run the #Trigger.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Summary:</strong> These options let you <strong>secure access</strong> so only authorized users can execute triggers, while also giving you the <strong>flexibility</strong> to tailor access for different roles or use cases.</p>
