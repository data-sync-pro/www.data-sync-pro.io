<p>Pagination is <strong>server-side</strong> for standard and custom objectsâ€”only the records for the current page are retrieved, optimizing performance and reducing memory usage.</p><p>For Salesforce <strong>Big Objects</strong>, pagination is <strong>client-side</strong> since Salesforce does not support the <code>OFFSET</code> clause. The full result set is returned, and Query Manager applies pagination locally. Use <code>LIMIT</code> to control the number of records retrieved.</p>
