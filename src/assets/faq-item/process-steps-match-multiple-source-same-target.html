    DSP applies transformations to the matched target record
    iteratively based on the <strong>order of the source records</strong>. When
    multiple source records are associated with the same target record, each one
    updates the target in turn â€” with later updates overwriting changes made by earlier ones, 
      resulting in a single final versionof the target record
    before execution.

  <p>
    To <strong>prevent</strong> this behavior, use the
    <strong><code>IS_FIRST_IN_ITERATION(...)</code></strong> function in the
    <strong>Scope Filter</strong> to ensure <strong>only the first</strong> source record per
    group is processed.
