    DSP applies transformations to the matched target record
    <strong>iteratively based on the order of the source records</strong>. When
    multiple source records are associated with the same target record, each one
    updates the target in turnâ€”<strong
      >with later updates overwriting changes made by earlier ones</strong
    >, resulting in a <strong>single final version</strong> of the target record
    before execution.
  </p>

  <p>
    To prevent this behavior, use the
    <strong><code>IS_FIRST_IN_ITERATION(...)</code></strong> function in the
    <strong>Scope Filter</strong> to ensure only the first source record per
    group is processed.
