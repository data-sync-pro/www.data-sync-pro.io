    To create an Actionable Data List in Data Sync Pro (DSP), start by creating an Executable
    associated with a Direction. Once created, DSP provides a guided interface to configure each
    step of the data list process:

  <br />
  <p><strong>Guided Steps for Defining an Actionable Data List:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Retrieve</strong> ‚Äì Configure how source data is queried from the connected org.
      Designers can preview data, test transformations, and execute selected records synchronously.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Scoping</strong> ‚Äì Refine the retrieved dataset using
      <strong>in-memory filters</strong> and optional joins with other datasets for multi-source
      enrichment.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Match</strong> ‚Äì Identify target records using matching rules. Supports insert-only
      logic, multi-field matching via transformations, and merge-specific logic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mapping</strong> ‚Äì Apply formulas and expressions to assign and transform target field
      values. Features
      <strong
        >auto-validation, relational field support, and a comprehensive function library.</strong
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Action</strong> ‚Äì Define the operations to be performed, such as Insert, Update,
      Upsert, Delete, Merge, Lead Convert, Send Email, and more. Configure behavior options like
      <strong>‚ÄúSkip Record Update if No Changes‚Äù and writeback.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Verify</strong> ‚Äì Select target fields to review after execution. These fields appear
      in the Batch Execution record, allowing review of source and target data side-by-side.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Additional Data List(Q) Settings:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Action on Target</strong> ‚Äì Configures how the action behaves, including button label
      and style, visibility on list or row level (or both), alert messages, and whether users can
      edit fields before executing the action.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Permissions (Query Results)</strong> ‚Äì Manages access to the data list based on user
      permissions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Appearance &amp; More</strong> ‚Äì Allows customization of layout, display settings, and
      UI behaviors.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    üìå This structured, intuitive interface ensures your Data List is interactive, reusable, and
    fully aligned with your business logic‚Äîwithout writing any code.
