    To create an <strong>Actionable Data List</strong> in Data Sync Pro (DSP), start by creating 
    an Executable associated with a <strong>Direction</strong>. 
    Once created, DSP provides a <strong>guided interface</strong> to configure 
    each step of the data list process:

  <p><strong>Guided Steps for Defining an Actionable Data List:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Retrieve</strong> - Configure how source data is queried 
      from the connected org. Designers can preview data, test transformations, 
      and execute selected records synchronously.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Scoping</strong> - Refine the retrieved dataset using 
      in-memory filters and optional joins with other datasets for 
      multi-source enrichment.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Match</strong> - Identify target records using matching 
      rules. Supports insert-only logic, multi-field matching via transformations, 
      and merge-specific logic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mapping</strong> - Apply formulas and expressions to assign 
      and transform target field values. Features auto-validation, relational 
      field support, and a comprehensive function library.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Action</strong> - Define the operations to be performed, 
      such as Insert, Update, Upsert, Delete, Merge, Lead Convert, Send Email, 
      and more. Configure behavior options like “<strong>Skip Record Update if No Changes</strong>” 
      and writeback.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Verify</strong> - Select target fields to review after 
      execution. These fields appear in the Batch Execution record, allowing 
      review of source and target data side-by-side.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Additional Data List(Q) Settings:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Action on Target</strong> - Configures how the action behaves, 
      including button label and style, visibility on list or row level (or both), 
      alert messages, and whether users can edit fields before executing the action.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Permissions (Query Results)</strong> - Manages access to the 
      data list based on user permissions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Appearance &amp; More</strong> - Allows customization of layout, 
      display settings, and UI behaviors.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    📌 This structured, intuitive interface ensures your Data List is <strong>interactive</strong>, 
    <strong>reusable</strong>, and fully aligned with your business logic—<strong>without writing any code</strong>.
