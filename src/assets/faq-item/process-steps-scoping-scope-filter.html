    A Scope Filter in Data Sync Pro (DSP) is a formula-based condition used during the
    <strong>Scoping</strong> step to determine which source records should proceed through
    execution. Scope Filters can either:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Evaluate to <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> to include or exclude records, or</li>
    <li>
      Raise a conditional error using the <code>ERROR()</code> function when validation criteria are
      met.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Scope Filters are <strong>evaluated sequentially</strong>, allowing for layered, modular
    filtering logic based on context:

  <h3><strong>Sequential Scope Filter Layers</strong></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Pipeline Scope Filter</strong><br />
      Applied when the Executable runs as part of a Pipeline. It acts as a global pre-filter to
      control record scope across all Executables in the Pipeline.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Executable Scope Filter</strong><br />
      Defines the core scoping condition for the individual Executableâ€”evaluated whether the
      Executable runs standalone or within a Pipeline.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Trigger Scope Filters</strong><br />
      Used specifically in <strong>Trigger Executables</strong>, these filters apply to defined
      trigger events (e.g., <strong>Before Insert</strong>, <strong>After Update</strong>) and allow
      further control through event-specific logic like
      <strong>Scope Filter (Before Update Trigger)</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Scope Filter (Post Join)</strong><br />
      Evaluated after the <strong>Join</strong> step, this filter enables additional refinement of
      the enriched source dataset.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Scope Filters provide precise and layered control, ensuring only relevant records proceed while
    allowing validation and filtering at multiple stages.
