<p><strong>Scope Filter</strong> is a formula-based condition used in the Scoping step to decide which source records <b>continue</b> through execution.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>It can return <strong>TRUE/FALSE</strong> to include or exclude records, or raise an error with the <code>ERROR()</code> function when validation rules are met.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scope Filters are evaluated in sequence, allowing layered logic at different levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pipeline Scope Filter:</strong> a global pre-filter across all Executables in a Pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Executable Scope Filter:</strong> the main condition for a single Executable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trigger Scope Filters:</strong> event-specific filters for Trigger Executables (e.g., Before Insert, After Update).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post-Join Scope Filter:</strong> applied after joins for extra refinement of enriched data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>Scope Filters give you flexible, precise control so only valid and relevant records move forward.<br></p>

    <p>
      <strong>Scope Filters</strong> provide <strong>precise</strong> and <strong>layered control</strong>, 
      ensuring <strong>only relevant records</strong> proceed while allowing validation 
      and filtering at multiple stages.
