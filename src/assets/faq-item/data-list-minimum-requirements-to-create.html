<p>
    Creating a <strong>#Data List</strong> requires only an <strong>Executable record</strong> 
    and a <strong>SOQL query</strong> for the source object, which can be 
    defined using <strong>Query Manager</strong> in the 
    <strong>Retrieve</strong> section.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Query Manager </strong>provides an intuitive UI for 
    building and refining SOQL queries, enabling the creation of powerful 
    <strong>#Data Lists </strong>with minimal effort. Check out the 
    Query Manager section for more details on how 
    a single query can drive a fully interactive <strong>#Data List </strong>
