      Data Sync Pro supports SDLC-aligned deployment through <strong>two flexible options</strong>, 
      designed to accommodate teams of all sizes:
    </p>
    <h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ Manual JSON Export &amp; Import <em>(Ideal for SMBs with simple processes)</em></h3>
    <p>
      DSP allows you to <strong> export Executables from a Pipeline as a JSON file </strong>, which can then be 
      manually imported into a Pipeline in the target environment. This method is straightforward 
      and effective for smaller teams with a limited number of Executables and minimal deployment 
      complexity.
    </p>
    <h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Deployment via DSP Migration <em>(Best for Medium to Large Enterprises)</em></h3>
    <p>
      For more systematic and scalable deployments, DSP provides a 
      <strong>standard migration template</strong> to move configuration data across Salesforce 
      environments. <br />
      Download the template, upload it to your Pipeline, and use the 
      <strong>Template Direction</strong> to define how data should flow. You can then execute 
      <strong>#Batches</strong> manually or schedule them for automated deployment.
