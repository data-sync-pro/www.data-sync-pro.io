<p>
  You can schedule <strong>Batch jobs</strong> by creating
  <strong>Schedule records</strong> associated with a
  <strong>Batch Executable</strong>, <strong>Pipeline</strong>, or a
  <strong>global Apex class</strong> implementing the Batchable or Schedulable
  interface.
</p>
<p>
  Since Salesforce imposes limits on scheduled jobs, using Pipelines to chain
  Batch Executables helps <strong>optimize scheduling resources</strong> and <strong>reduce job
  consumption</strong>.
