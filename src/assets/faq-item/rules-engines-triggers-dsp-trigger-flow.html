<p>When a record is <strong>inserted, updated, deleted, or undeleted</strong> in Salesforce, DSP follows a structured execution process to enforce rules-driven automation:</p>
    <pre><code>Trigger Event Detection → Scoping → Match → Mapping → Action</code></pre>
    <p>
      This ensures that trigger actions and transformations are <strong>efficiently processed</strong> 
      while maintaining scalability and performance.
