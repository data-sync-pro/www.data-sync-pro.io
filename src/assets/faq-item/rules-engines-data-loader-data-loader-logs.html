    <strong>Execution logs</strong> in a Data Loader process are recorded as
    <strong>related records</strong> in DSP for detailed tracking, troubleshooting, and compliance.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Each Execution record is associated with the <strong>Data Loader Executable</strong> and
    captures key details such as execution status, processed records, errors, and timestamps. Within
    each execution, <strong>Batch Execution records</strong> are created as related records,
    providing granular visibility into individual batch runs.

    This structured logging approach ensures transparency, making it easy to review, analyze, and
    troubleshoot data loads efficiently.
