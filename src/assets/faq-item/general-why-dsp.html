<p>Unlike tools that simply swap code for drag-and-drop screens while still leaving complexity to the designers, DSP is <b>rules-driven</b>, <b>modular</b>, and <b>record-based</b> at its core. This approach simplifies business logic, promotes single responsibility principle, and enforces clear boundaries—delivering streamlined processes, simpler systems, and enterprise-scale performance across every Salesforce org.</p><h3><strong>Key Benefits</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Great Performance – Batch jobs up to 20× faster</strong><br>
DSP's Batch engine is optimized for Salesforce governor limits, executing jobs up to 20× faster than Apex batch. It supports complex transformations, cleansing, and large-scale operations at enterprise speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bulkified Transformation – 140+ functions</strong><br>
Leverage 140+ built-in functions & variables—covering strings, dates, math, booleans, lookups, regex, roll-ups, masking, triggers and extend the library thru an Apex interface for the most tailored transformations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Streamlining & Empowering – Covers most customization needs</strong><br>
With five rules engines—#Batch, #Trigger, #Data List, #Action Button, and #Data Loader—and actions such as #Insert, #Update, #Delete, #Undelete, #Merge, #Publish, #Lead Convert, #Notifications, and #Approvals, DSP addresses most customization scenarios while cutting build effort by up to <strong>90%.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rules-Driven Simplicity</strong><br>
Business logic is expressed as clear, declarative rules—significantly reducing complexity for architects, admins, and developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modular & Record-Based</strong><br>
Rules are stored as structured records—bounded, reusable, and easy to maintain. Each module defines clear inputs and outputs for predictable scalability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enterprise Security – Local Processing</strong><br>
All execution runs natively inside Salesforce, ensuring compliance and eliminating external data movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drastically Reduced Technical Debt</strong><br>
The modular, record-based framework replaces tightly-coupled Apex and Flow implementations with clean, bounded logic. By isolating complexity and enforcing single responsibility, DSP drastically lowers long-term technical debt.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>With DSP, you gain a single, powerful platform to implement, maintain, and scale Salesforce data processes—faster, safer, and simpler with long-term scalablity.</p><p><br></p>
