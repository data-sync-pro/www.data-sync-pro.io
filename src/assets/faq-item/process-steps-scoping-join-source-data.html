<p><b>Joiners</b> are configured in the <strong>Scoping</strong> section to 
      <strong>combine source records with an additional dataset</strong> 
      for advanced processing. You can use one of the following functions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>JOIN_OBJECT</code> - Combines source data with another <strong>Salesforce object</strong> 
        or <strong>Custom Setting</strong> from a configured <strong>Connection</strong>.</li>
      <li><code>JOIN_JSON</code> - Combines source data with a <strong>JSON array</strong> represented as a string.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>How It Works</strong><br>
      A Joiner operates as one of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Left Join</strong> - When <em>matching keys</em> are specified, each source record is paired 
        with matching records from the additional dataset.</li>
      <li><strong>Cross Join</strong> - When <em>no matching keys</em> are provided, 
        each source record is paired with <strong>every record</strong> in the additional dataset.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Referencing Joined Fields</strong><br>
      After joining, fields from the additional dataset can be referenced using:  
       <code>$Joiner.FieldName</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      These joined fields can be used in:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scope Filter (Post Join)</strong> - for further data refinement</li>
        <li><strong>Mapping</strong> - for applying field transformations using the joined values</li>
      </ul>

      ðŸ“Œ Joiners allow you to augment source records with additional data sets, 
      enabling more advanced transformations.
