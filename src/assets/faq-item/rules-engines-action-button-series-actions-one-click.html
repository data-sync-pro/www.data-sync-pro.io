<p>An #<b>Action</b> <b>Button</b> by itself runs a single configured action flow. To execute multiple actions in sequence, you can set it to update a record that meets the scope of a DSP Trigger. When the Trigger fires, it can launch additional downstream actions—such as record updates, notifications, emails, lead conversions, or other business processes—allowing a single button click to drive a full series of steps.</p>
