    The <strong>Retrieve step</strong> in Data Sync Pro (DSP) defines
    how source data is queried from a connected Salesforce org. It serves as
    the entry point for record selection in both <strong>Batches</strong> and
    <strong>Data Lists</strong>.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>In Batches:</strong> Retrieve specifies the source records used
      during batch execution—similar to the data returned by the
      <code>start()</code> method in Salesforce's
      <code>Database.Batchable</code> interface.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>In Data Lists:</strong> Retrieve defines the SOQL query used
      to display records to users in the UI.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    At runtime, DSP automatically fetches only the fields required by
    downstream steps—<strong>Scoping</strong>, <strong>Match</strong>, and <strong>Mapping</strong>—based on
    actual usage. The fields selected in the Retrieve query are used only
    for <strong>preview</strong> and <strong>display purposes</strong>.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Retrieve enables intuitive query configuration while DSP intelligently
    fetches only what's needed for efficient execution.
