<p>In #Data Loader, the <strong>Input Data Key Field</strong> is the unique identifier (case-sensitive) for each source record. It is used internally for processing, logging, and maintaining record references during execution.</p><p>If no key field is defined, DSP defaults to using the row index. However, specifying a key field is recommended to improve data integrity and tracking.</p>
