      Scoping in Data Sync Pro (DSP) refines source data 
      <strong>in-memory</strong> using <strong>filters</strong> and <strong>joins</strong> 
      to define the dataset for downstream processing. It is available 
      in all DSP rules engines, including <strong>Batch</strong>, 
      <strong>Data Lists</strong>, <strong>Triggers</strong>, 
      <strong>Action Buttons</strong>, and <strong>Data Loader</strong>.

      <strong>Key Functions of Scoping:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Scope Filters (In-Memory Filtering)</strong> –  
          Use DSP <strong>formulas</strong> and <strong>expressions</strong> to define precise 
          conditions for which source records should continue to Match, Mapping, 
          and Action steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enriching Data (Left Join or Cross Join)</strong> –  
          Join source data with another object (from any Connection) 
          or with a JSON array, allowing 
          multi-source enrichment and dynamic filtering 
          across related datasets.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Scoping is used for 
      <strong>advanced source data refinement</strong> that cannot be handled 
      in the initial SOQL query (<strong>Retrieve</strong>). It runs <strong>after retrieval</strong> 
      or <strong>upload</strong>, but <strong>before</strong> <strong>Match</strong>, <strong>Mapping</strong>, and <strong>Actions</strong>.
