    <p>
      When the target object is a <strong>Salesforce Big Object</strong>, 
      DSP supports the following actions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         <strong>Insert</strong> - Adds new records. If a record with the 
        specified index fields already exists, <em>Salesforce will override 
        the existing record</em>, even though the action is set to 
        "Insert." This is a standard Salesforce functionality.
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Delete</strong> - Removes existing records based on the index.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      "<strong>Target Big Object Index Fields</strong>" must be configured 
      to ensure proper data processing.
    </p>
