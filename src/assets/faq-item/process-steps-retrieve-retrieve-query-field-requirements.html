      No, it's <strong>not necessary</strong>. DSP <strong>automatically determines which fields need 
      to be retrieved</strong> during execution based on the entire process. The fields 
      defined in the Retrieve query are used solely for previewing the source 
      data and do not need to include every field referenced downstream.
