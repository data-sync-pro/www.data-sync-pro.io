      A Trigger Action in DSP is a rule-based automation that 
      executes <strong>specific actions</strong> when a record meets <strong>defined criteria</strong> during a 
      Salesforce trigger event (e.g., Before Insert, After Update). Unlike 
      Self-Adaptive Triggers, which modify and validate fields within the 
      same record, Trigger Actions use the triggering records as a <strong>source</strong> 
      to perform separate operations on related or different records.

      When a trigger event occurs, DSP evaluates Scope Filters to determine 
      which records qualify for execution. Once matched, a Trigger Action can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Update related records</strong> (e.g., modify a parent record when a child record changes; update child records when a parent record changes).</li>
      <li><strong>Create new records</strong>(e.g., generate tasks, log entries, or follow-ups).</li>
      <li><strong>Send notifications</strong> (e.g., email alerts or in-app bell notifications).</li>
      <li><strong>Publish Platform Events</strong> for seamless integration with external systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      DSP automatically bulkifies Trigger Actions and prevents recursion, ensuring 
      efficient execution across large data volumesâ€”without requiring Apex development.
