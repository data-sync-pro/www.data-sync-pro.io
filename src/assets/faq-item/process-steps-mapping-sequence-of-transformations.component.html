      To control the order in which target fields are evaluated during Mapping:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        After configuring the Mapping step, go to the <strong>Related</strong> 
        tab on the Executable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Locate the <strong>Field Mappings</strong> related list.
      </li>
      <li>
        Edit the <strong>Seq No.</strong> column inline to define the desired 
        evaluation order.
      </li>
      <li>
        Save your changes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ðŸ“Œ When <strong>Seq No.</strong> is specified, DSP evaluates field mappings 
      in that order. If the <strong>source and target are the same record</strong>, 
      transformations are <strong>accumulative</strong>â€”meaning the result of 
      a previously evaluated field can be used in subsequent transformations. 
      This is useful when one fieldâ€™s output depends on anotherâ€™s value.
    </p>
