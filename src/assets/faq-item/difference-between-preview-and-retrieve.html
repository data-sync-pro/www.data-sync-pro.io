<p>
  Both Preview and Retrieve run a SOQL query to fetch source data, but they
  serve different roles:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Retrieve</strong> (used in #Batch and #Data List) defines which
      records are processed or displayed during execution.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Preview</strong> (used in #Triggers and #Action Buttons) does not
      affect input data; instead, it lets you inspect source records and their
      transformed values before execution.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In short, Retrieve controls the records that run, while Preview helps you
  validate data and transformations without changing the input.
