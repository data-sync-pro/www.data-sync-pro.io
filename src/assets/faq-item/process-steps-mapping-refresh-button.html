<p>The <strong>Refresh</strong> button updates the Mapping section with the latest source and target fields, making new fields available for mapping. It also re-sorts target fields into categories (Target Matching Field, Mapped Fields, Reference Fields, Non-Reference Fields), with mapped fields listed first and all fields sorted alphabetically for easier selection.</p>
