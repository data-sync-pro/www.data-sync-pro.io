      The <strong>"Refresh"</strong> button reloads the list of available 
      source and target fields in the Mapping section, ensuring that any newly 
      added fields in the source or target objects are reflected and available 
      for mapping. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, DSP re-sorts the target fields into the following categories 
      for better organization:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Target Matching Field</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Mapped Fields with Seq No.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Reference Fields</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Non-Reference Fields</strong></li>
      </ul>
 
    <p>
      Within each category: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mapped fields</strong> appear before non-mapped fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Target fields</strong> are sorted alphabetically.</li>
      </ul>
 
    <p>
      This structured sorting enhances usability and simplifies field selection.
