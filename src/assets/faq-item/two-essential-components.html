  An <b>Actionable</b> <b>#Data List</b> is defined within a Direction-based Executable and is
  built from two key components:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Query Manager</strong> – A Lightning Web Component (LWC) that
      defines the source data using a SOQL query. It provides an intuitive,
      no-code interface for building and managing queries with features such as
      a query builder, dynamic filters, pagination, CRUD operations, inline
      editing, column filters, and CSV export—offering complete control over
      data retrieval and interaction.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Custom Actions</strong> – Defines both row-level and list-level
      actions on selected records, such as applying rules-driven
      transformations, performing DML operations, sending notifications or
      emails, converting leads, or triggering approval processes.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Together, these components make a Data List a dynamic, interactive datatable
  that enables rich engagement with records through a rules-driven, declarative
  setup.
