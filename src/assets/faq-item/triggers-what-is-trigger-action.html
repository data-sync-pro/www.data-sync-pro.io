<p>A #Trigger Action executes operations on other records when a trigger event occurs. Unlike a Self-Adaptive #Trigger, which modifies the same record, a #Trigger Action uses the triggering records as a <strong>source</strong> to perform actions on related or different records.</p><p>When a trigger event fires, DSP evaluates the <strong>Scope Filters</strong> to determine which records qualify. Once matched, a #Trigger Action can:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Update related records</strong> – e.g., modify a parent when a child changes, or cascade updates down to child records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create new records</strong> – e.g., generate tasks, log entries, or follow-ups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Send notifications</strong> – e.g., email alerts or in-app bell notifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publish Platform Events</strong> – enabling integration with external systems.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This makes #Trigger Actions ideal for handling <strong>cross-record logic</strong> such as synchronizing parent–child data, automating downstream processes, and sending notifications.</p>
