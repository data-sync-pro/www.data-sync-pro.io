<p>An Actionable #Data List in DSP is defined within a Direction-Based Executable and is built from two key components:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Query Manager (Q)</strong> – A Lightning Web Component (LWC) that defines the source data using a SOQL query. It provides an intuitive, no-code interface for building and managing queries with features such as a query builder, dynamic filters, pagination, CRUD operations, inline editing, column filters, and CSV export—offering complete control over data retrieval and interaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom Actions</strong> – Defines both row-level and list-level actions on selected records, such as applying rules-driven transformations, performing DML operations, sending notifications or emails, converting leads, or triggering approval processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Together, these components make a Data List a dynamic, interactive datatable that enables rich engagement with records through a rules-driven, declarative setup.</p>
