  <p>
    An <strong>Actionable Data List</strong> in Data Sync Pro is defined within a 
    <strong>Direction-based Executable</strong> and consists of two key components:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Query Manager(Q)</strong><br />
      A powerful Lightning Web Component (LWC) that defines the source data 
      using a SOQL query. It provides a <strong>no-code</strong>, <strong>intuitive interface</strong> for 
      building and managing queries, with features like autocomplete, 
      dynamic filters, pagination, inline editing, mass actions, record 
      creation, and CSV export—offering full control over data retrieval 
      and interaction.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Custom Actions with Transformations</strong><br />
      Defines the <strong>Row Actions</strong> and <strong>List Actions</strong> 
      users can perform on selected records—such as applying formula-based 
      transformations, updating records, sending notifications or emails, 
      converting leads, and triggering downstream logic.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Together, these components make the Data List a <strong>dynamic</strong>, <strong>interactive</strong> tool 
    for <strong>real-time</strong> engagement with Salesforce data—<strong>without writing code</strong>
