  <p>
    The default <strong>New Record</strong> action in a <strong>#Data List</strong> uses
    <strong>Salesforce's standard LWC API</strong> to create a new record, which
    opens a blank form based on the page layout. After saving, users must
    manually refresh the <strong>#Data List </strong>to view the new record.
  </p>

  <p>
    By replacing this with a
    <strong>global Executable Action Button</strong>—configured via the
    "<strong>Q: New Record Executable API Name</strong>" field—Data Sync Pro
    offers a more streamlined and customizable experience:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
       <strong>Pre-filled Forms</strong> - Use DSP transformations to populate
      fields with relevant values.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong>Editable Before Save</strong> - Users can adjust the pre-filled
      values before submitting.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong>Automatic Refresh</strong> - The <strong>#Data List </strong>refreshes
      automatically after record creation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
     This approach provides a more <strong>convenient</strong>,
    <strong>transformation-powered</strong> alternative to standard record
    creation, supporting streamlined customization and better user flow.
