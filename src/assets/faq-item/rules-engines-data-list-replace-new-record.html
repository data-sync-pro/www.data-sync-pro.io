    The default <strong>New Record</strong> action in a Data List uses
    <strong>Salesforce’s standard LWC API</strong> to create a new record, which opens a blank form
    based on the page layout. After saving, users must manually refresh the Data List to view the
    new record.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    By replacing this with a
    <strong>global Executable Action Button</strong>—configured via the
    <strong>"Q: New Record Executable API Name"</strong> field—Data Sync Pro offers a more
    streamlined and customizable experience:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Pre-filled Forms</strong> – Use DSP transformations to populate fields with relevant
      values.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Editable Before Save</strong> – Users can adjust the pre-filled values before
      submitting.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Automatic Refresh</strong> – The Data List refreshes automatically after record
      creation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This approach provides a more <strong>convenient</strong>,
    <strong>transformation-powered</strong> alternative to standard record creation, supporting
    streamlined customization and better user flow.
