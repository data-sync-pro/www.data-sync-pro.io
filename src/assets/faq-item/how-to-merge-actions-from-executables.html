<p>When multiple Executable Data Lists in a Pipeline share the same source query, their actions are automatically merged into one unified Data List. This lets users work with a single list while still accessing all actions defined across those Executables.</p><p><strong>To enable this:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>Ensure the Executables in the Pipeline use the <strong>same source query</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the <strong>Pipeline Data Lists</strong> component to a Lightning page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure the Data Lists within the Pipeline to control order of the actions</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This approach streamlines the user experience by eliminating duplication and consolidating actions into a single, interactive view.</p>
