      An Action Button in Data Sync Pro (DSP) is a
      <strong>no-code</strong>, <strong>record-based rules engine</strong> that enables business
      users to trigger data transformations and actions instantly with a single click—directly from the Salesforce Lightning UI.

      Each Action Button is defined in an Executable record, with
      a guided user interface that makes configuration intuitive
      and maintainable. It supports powerful transformations
      using DSP's formula engine and allows users to
      <strong>review and edit transformed field values before execution</strong>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Supported actions include <strong>Insert</strong>, <strong>Update</strong>, <strong>Delete</strong>, 
      <strong>Merge</strong>, <strong>Lead Conversion</strong>, <strong>Send Emails</strong>, 
      <strong>Publish Platform Events</strong>, <strong>Bell Notifications</strong>,
      and <strong>more</strong>.
    </p>

      Action Buttons can be added to Lightning pages as
      Quick Actions or surfaced as a customizable group
      of buttons using a Lightning Web Component—empowering business
      users with <strong>real-time</strong>, <strong>rules-driven automation inside Salesforce</strong>.
