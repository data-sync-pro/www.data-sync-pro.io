      A Self-Adaptive Trigger in DSP is a trigger-based automation 
      that transforms and validates fields within the same records before they are 
      committed to the database. Unlike standard trigger actions that perform 
      operations on related records, Self-Adaptive Triggers focus on making 
      <strong>real-time modifications</strong> to the triggering records themselves.

    <p>
      When a record is <strong>inserted</strong> or <strong>updated</strong>, DSP evaluates predefined formulas 
      and transformations to dynamically update, validate, or re-calculate fields 
      based on business logic. These operations occur <strong>before</strong> or <strong>after</strong> 
      the DML event, ensuring that records are properly modified before being saved.

      Self-Adaptive Triggers are <strong>bulkified</strong>, meaning they efficiently process <strong>multiple 
      records</strong> at once, reducing the need for custom Apex logic. They are commonly 
      used for data standardization, field recalculations, validation rules, 
      and enforcing business logic—<strong>all without writing code</strong>.
