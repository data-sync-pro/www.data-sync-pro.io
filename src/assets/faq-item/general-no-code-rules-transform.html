      <strong>No-code</strong>, <strong>modular</strong>, and <strong>record-based rules</strong> fundamentally 
      transform enterprise data management by providing a structured approach that <strong>simplifies complex
      data processes</strong>, <strong>reduces technical debt</strong>, and <strong>ensures scalability</strong> and
      <strong>maintainability across the enterprise</strong>.

      <strong>No-code Approach:</strong><br />
      Empowers non-technical users to implement, manage, and maintain data
      processes <strong>without writing</strong> or <strong>managing complex code</strong>, greatly accelerating
      development and reducing operational overhead.

    <p>
      <strong>Modular Data Processes:</strong><br />
      Breaks down data processes into clearly defined, self-contained components,
      <strong>simplifying collaboration</strong>, <strong>troubleshooting</strong>, and <strong>ongoing enhancements</strong>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Record-based Business Rules:</strong><br />
      Encapsulate business logic within clearly structured records. Because each
      rule is bounded and self-contained, complexity is effectively isolated and
      controlled, ensuring <strong>easier reuse</strong>, <strong>consistent implementation</strong>, <strong>minimal
      dependency management</strong>, and <strong>streamlined deployment</strong>.

      Many existing no-code solutions primarily transform traditional code into
      visual UI components. However, like traditional coding, these solutions
      still leave modularity up to designers, forcing them to manually handle
      complex logic and bulkification, which inevitably leads to complexity and
      technical debt. In contrast, combining true no-code capabilities, inherent
      modularity, and structured record-based rules <strong>effectively resolves these
      challenges</strong>, establishing a sustainable foundation for the future of
      enterprise data management.
