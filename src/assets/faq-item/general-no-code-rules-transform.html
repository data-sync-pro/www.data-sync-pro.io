<p>Rules-driven, modular, record-based methods transform enterprise data management by making complex processes simpler, more scalable, and easier to maintain—while reducing technical debt.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rules-Driven</strong> – Allows architects, admins, and developers to define and maintain business logic as straightforward rules, with clarity and simplicity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modular</strong> – Breaks processes into self-contained components, making them easier to build, change, understand, and reuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Record-Based</strong> – Stores business logic as structured records, isolating complexity and ensuring <b>clear boundaries</b> between modules.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Unlike traditional tools that only swaps code with drag-and-drop screens but still leave complexity to the designers—<strong>Data Sync Pro embeds modularity and record-based rules at its core, eliminating complexity at the source and creating a sustainable, future-proof data management framework.</strong></p>
