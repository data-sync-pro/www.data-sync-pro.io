      To prevent repeated execution during recursive updates, enable the 
      "<strong>Run Once on Recursive Updates?</strong>". When enabled, DSP ensures that the trigger logic runs <strong>only once</strong> 
      per triggering record per trigger event (Before Update or After Update)â€”even 
      if the record is updated again due to other automations within the same 
      transaction.
    </p>

      This helps avoid duplicate execution, infinite loops, and 
      unnecessary overhead in complex automation scenarios.
