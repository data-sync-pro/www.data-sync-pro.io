      If the target object is a <strong>Platform Event</strong>, set the <strong>Action</strong> to "<strong>Publish</strong>". 
      Upon execution, DSP publishes the event records, allowing event subscribers 
      to consume them in <strong>real-time</strong> for <strong>asynchronous processing</strong> and <strong>integrations</strong>.
