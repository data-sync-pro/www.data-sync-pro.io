  The <strong>Retrieve</strong> step defines how source data is queried from a
  connected Salesforce org. It's the entry point for record selection in both
  #Batches and #Data Lists.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>In Batches:</strong> Retrieve specifies the source records for
      batch executionâ€”similar to the <code>start()</code> method in Salesforce's
      <code>Database.Batchable</code> interface.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>In Data Lists:</strong> Retrieve defines the SOQL query used to
      display records to users in the UI.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  At runtime, DSP automatically fetches only the fields required by downstream
  steps (Scoping, Match, Mapping). Fields selected in the Retrieve query are
  used mainly for preview and display.
</p>
<p>
  This design makes query configuration simple and intuitive, while ensuring DSP
  executes efficiently with only the fields actually needed.
