<p><strong>Yes</strong>, changes made by a data load can be reverted depending on the action type and configuration. DSP provides flexible rollback options:</p><h3><strong>For Updates</strong>:</h3><blockquote>If "<strong>Log to File</strong>" is enabled, the target target data is saved as a JSON log file before the update. To revert updates, use "<strong>Restore Updated From Log File</strong>" quick action on the Batch Execution or Execution record.</blockquote><h3><strong>For Inserts:</strong></h3><ul><li>Click "<strong>Delete Inserted Records</strong>" from the Execution record to delete all records inserted.</li><li>To delete records from a specific batch, go to the Batch Execution record, open the <strong>Verify</strong> tab, select and delete target records directly from the data list.</li></ul><h3><strong>For Deletes:</strong></h3><ul><li>Use "<strong>Restore From Recycle Bin</strong>" if the records are still available there.</li><li>If "<strong>Log to File</strong>" is enabled, use "<strong>Re-Create Deleted From Log File</strong>" on the Batch Execution to restore deleted data from the saved log file.</li></ul><hr><p>⚠️ <strong>Note:</strong> Reversion is <strong>not supported</strong> when "<strong>Action to Bulk API</strong>" is enabled.</p><p>These rollback features help ensure reliable recovery from unintended updates, inserts, or deletions, supporting safer data operations in DSP.</p>
