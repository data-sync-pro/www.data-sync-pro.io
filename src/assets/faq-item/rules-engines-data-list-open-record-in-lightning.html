      Enable the <strong>"Q: Open Links in Record Page?"</strong> setting on the Data List 
      Executable. 
      When checked, clicking a record in the Data List opens it in the standard <strong>Lightning record page</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      📌 If this option is <strong>unchecked</strong>, records open in DSP’s 
      <strong>raw record view</strong>—a plain interface that displays all fields 
      from the source record.

      If the Data List is based on a <strong>Direction-based Executable</strong> 
      with a defined target action, users will also see a <strong>preview of the 
      transformed values</strong> before the action is executed, providing visibility 
      into how the data will be processed.
