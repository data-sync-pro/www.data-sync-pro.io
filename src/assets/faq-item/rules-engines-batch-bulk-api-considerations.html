  <p>
    Enabling <strong>Bulk API</strong> in Data Sync Pro (DSP) offers significant performance
    improvements, but it comes with certain trade-offs:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Benefits</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Extraordinary Performance Gains</strong> &ndash; With the
          right batch size (up to 2,000 records per batch), Bulk API can process
          large data volumes <strong>much faster</strong> than the standard API.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Drawbacks</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Asynchronous Processing</strong> &ndash; Since Salesforce
          processes Bulk API jobs asynchronously, users must monitor the
          execution status directly in Salesforce.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Data Reversion</strong> &ndash; Actions performed via Bulk
          API cannot be reverted, meaning features like
          <em>"Restore Updated From Log File"</em> or
          <em>"Re-Create Deleted From Log File"</em> are not supported.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Bulk API is ideal for <strong>high-volume processing</strong> but <strong>requires careful setup</strong> and
    <strong>monitoring for optimal use</strong>.
