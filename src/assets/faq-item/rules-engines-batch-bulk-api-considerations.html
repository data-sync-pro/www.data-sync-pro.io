<p>Enabling <strong>Bulk API</strong> in Data Sync Pro (DSP) delivers major performance benefits but also introduces important trade-offs:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Extraordinary Performance Gains</strong> – With larger batch sizes (up to 2,000 records per batch), Bulk API can process large data volumes significantly faster than the standard API.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asynchronous Processing</strong> – Bulk API jobs run asynchronously after DSP’s batch submissions. You must monitor execution status directly in Salesforce’s <strong>Bulk Data Load Jobs</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Data Reversion</strong> – Actions performed via Bulk API cannot be reverted. Features such as <em>Restore Updated From Log File</em> or <em>Re-Create Deleted From Log File</em> are not supported.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>Bulk API is ideal for <strong>high-volume processing</strong>, but it requires <strong>careful setup and active monitoring</strong> for optimal use.</p>
