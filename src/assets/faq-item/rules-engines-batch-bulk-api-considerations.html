    Enabling Bulk API in Data Sync Pro (DSP) offers significant performance improvements, but it
    comes with certain trade-offs:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Benefits
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Extraordinary Performance Gains</strong> &ndash; With the right batch size (up to
          2,000 records per batch), Bulk API can process large data volumes much faster than the
          standard API.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Drawbacks
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Asynchronous Processing</strong> &ndash; Since Salesforce processes Bulk API jobs
          asynchronously, users must monitor the execution status directly in Salesforce.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Data Reversion</strong> &ndash; Actions performed via Bulk API cannot be
          reverted, meaning features like <em>"Restore Updated From Log File"</em> or
          <em>"Re-Create Deleted From Log File"</em> are not supported.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Bulk API is ideal for high-volume processing but requires careful setup and monitoring for
    optimal use.
