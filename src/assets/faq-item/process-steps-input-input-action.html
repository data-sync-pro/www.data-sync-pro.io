      In <strong>Data Loader</strong>, Input defines the <strong>data profile</strong> of 
      a CSV file, specifying how the file's columns map to fields in DSP. 
      It is used in <strong>Scoping</strong> and <strong>Field Mappings</strong> to structure the incoming 
      data before processing.

      <strong>Key Note</strong>: Unlike other rules engines where data comes from a 
      Salesforce object, in Data Loader, the Input section ensures that 
      uploaded CSV data is correctly <strong>interpreted</strong> and <strong>aligned for 
      transformation</strong> and <strong>execution</strong>.
