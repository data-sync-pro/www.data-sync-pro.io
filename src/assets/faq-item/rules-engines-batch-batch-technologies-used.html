<p>#<b>Batch</b> is built fully on Salesforce-native technologies—<strong>Apex</strong> for backend execution and <strong>Lightning Web Components (LWC)</strong> for the user interface. All processing stays entirely within your Salesforce org for maximum security. Unlike traditional Apex batch classes, DSP’s #Batch runs on a proprietary optimized execution framework, purpose-built to handle large-scale data operations faster and more efficiently.</p>
