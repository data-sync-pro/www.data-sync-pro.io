<p><b>Execution</b> logs are captured as related records in DSP to provide detailed tracking, troubleshooting, and compliance. Each <b>Execution</b> record is linked to its Data Loader Executable and includes key details such as execution status, number of processed records, errors, and timestamps. Within each execution, <b>Batch Execution </b>records are created as related records, giving granular visibility into individual batch runs. This structured logging approach ensures transparency and makes it easy to review, analyze, and troubleshoot data loads efficiently.</p>
