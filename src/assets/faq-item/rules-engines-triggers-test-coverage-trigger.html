<p>In Salesforce, every Apex Trigger must have at least one line of code covered by a test class before it can be deployed to production.</p><p>For DSP triggers, each Apex Trigger contains a single line:</p><pre><div><div><code>pushtopics.TriggerServices.execute();
</code></div></div></pre><p>To meet the coverage requirement, write a test class that performs a <strong>DML operation</strong> (such as an insert, update, or delete) on the object tied to the trigger. This will invoke the trigger and automatically cover the line.</p><p>For deployment coverage, a simple DML test is enough. If you also want to validate the business logic defined in Executables, extend your test classes to check the expected outcomes.</p>
