  You can create a <b>#Data Loader</b> by clicking
  <strong>New Executable (Action)</strong> from a Connection record. When
  setting up the Executable, specify a target object, choose an action, and
  upload a template CSV file to define the data profile. The column names in the
  CSV must start with a letter and may only include letters, numbers, and
  underscores (“_”), ensuring they can be referenced consistently when building
  transformation formulas.
