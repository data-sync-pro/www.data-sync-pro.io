    A <strong>self-adaptive trigger</strong> evaluates fields in a
    <strong>before insert</strong> or <strong>before update</strong> trigger
    using DSP formulas. A blank update batch retrieves records that need
    updating and performs an update operation without modifying any fields.
    During this update, the self-adaptive trigger
    <strong>re-evaluates all fields</strong> based on the defined transformation
    logic.

    Benefits of Combining a Blank Update Batch with a Self-Adaptive Trigger:
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Reusable &amp; Universal Automation</strong> &ndash; The
      self-adaptive trigger runs automatically regardless of whether the update
      is triggered by a batch job, web service, Apex, or manual update, ensuring
      consistency.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Performance Optimization</strong> &ndash; When the blank update
      batch is executed with <em>Bulk API</em> enabled (batch size: 2,000), the
      calculations run significantly faster than traditional Apex batch jobs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Modular &amp; Decoupled System</strong> &ndash; Keeping batch
      execution and automation separate ensures a simplified, modular, and
      maintainable system, making debugging and scaling easier.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For example, this method is particularly useful for calculating
    <strong>roll-up summaries</strong> or <strong>aggregated values</strong> across child
    records. If a parent record needs to maintain a sum, count, or average of
    related child records, a blank update batch can trigger the <strong>recalculation
    automatically</strong> via the self-adaptive trigger, eliminating the need for
    additional processing logic.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach enhances <strong>efficiency</strong>, <strong>reusability</strong>, and performance while
    <strong>ensuring dynamic</strong>, <strong>automated recalculations</strong>.
