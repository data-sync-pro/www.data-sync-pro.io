  Very little. DSP is built natively on Salesforce (Apex and LWC) and introduces
  just seven intuitive configuration objectsâ€”Connection, Direction, Pipeline,
  Executable, Field Mapping, Variable, and Schedule. Most are self-explanatory
  by name.

  Building processes is as simple as creating records from these objects, with a
  one-time setup for Apex Triggers or Lightning Pages. Each rules engine has a
  guided interface with step-by-step configuration and smart features like
  autocomplete for filters, mappings, and formulas.

  DSP also provides user manuals and starter recipes, so most teams are building
  useful rules within just a few hours.
