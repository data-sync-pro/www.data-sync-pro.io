    Getting started with Data Sync Pro requires minimal training. DSP is built entirely on
    <strong>Salesforce-native</strong> technologies (Apex and LWC) and introduces only
    <strong>seven intuitive configuration objects</strong>— Connection, Direction, Pipeline,
    Executable, Field Mapping, Variable, and Schedule—whose purposes are mostly self-explanatory by
    name.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Creating data processes in DSP simply involves creating records from these configuration
    objects, along with a <strong>one-time integration</strong> via Apex Triggers or Lightning
    Pages. Each rules engine comes with <strong>guided user interfaces</strong>,
    <strong>step-by-step configuration</strong>, and
    <strong>capability-based fields</strong>
    that help users design rules easily within Executable records.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    DSP provides <strong>autocomplete suggestions</strong> for filters, field mappings, and
    variables to simplify building formulas.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    To support new users, DSP also includes
    <strong>comprehensive user manuals</strong> and <strong>starter recipes</strong> to help teams
    ramp up quickly.
  </p>

    Thanks to its intuitive design and shared architecture across rules engines, most users are able
    to start building rules within a few hours.
