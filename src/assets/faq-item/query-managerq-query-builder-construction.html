    <p>
      For those accustomed to manually typing SOQL queries, 
      Query Manager(Q) seamlessly integrates both manual 
      input and UI-assisted query building. As you type an object name, 
      <strong>Q automatically matches the object</strong>, allowing you to 
      <strong>continue selecting fields</strong>, <strong>applying filters</strong>, <strong>ordering results</strong>, 
      and <strong>grouping data</strong> using the intuitive UI.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      However, the <strong>preferred</strong> method for constructing a 
      standard SOQL query is by using the <strong>Query Builder</strong>, 
      which offers an intuitive and efficient way to build queries with 
      the following capabilities:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Object Selection</strong> - As you type the object name, 
        matched objects appear for selection.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Field Selection</strong> - Click <em>"Select Fields"</em> 
        to filter and choose fields from the current object or parent relationships, 
        while also adjusting the field sequence order.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Relationship Selection</strong> - Choose from all available 
        parent relationships, with support for up to 5-level relationships.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adding Filters</strong> - Select a field, choose an operator 
        (based on field type), and enter a value or select from hints. 
        Query Builder automatically applies the correct syntax.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Complex Filter Logic</strong> - Use natural language expressions 
        to define advanced filtering logic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sorting Results</strong> - Add ascending or descending order fields.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Grouping Data</strong> - Define GROUP BY fields to aggregate results.
      </li>
    </ul>
