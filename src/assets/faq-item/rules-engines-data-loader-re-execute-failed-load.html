<p>If <strong>“Log to File?”</strong> is enabled, the input CSV data is stored as a <strong>ContentDocument</strong>. This allows DSP to selectively replay failed portions of the load. From the Execution record, you can choose <strong>“Re-Execute Failed Batches”</strong> to run only the batches that previously failed. This approach preserves the successful batches, avoids duplicating data loads, and ensures efficient recovery from errors without restarting the entire process.</p>
