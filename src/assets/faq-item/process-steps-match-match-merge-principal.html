    <p>
      In the Merge process, DSP uses the 
      <strong>Principal Matched Record Selection Rule</strong> to identify 
      the <strong>principal (master) record</strong> among the matched records. 
      This is the record that will be retained after the merge, while the 
      others are marked for deletion.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>Available Selection Rules:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Most Complete</strong> - Chooses the record with the highest 
        number of populated fields.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Most Child Records</strong> - Selects the record with the most 
        related child records. Specify the child relationship name in the 
        <strong>Principal Selection Child Relationship</strong> field.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Most Recently Modified</strong> - Uses the record with the 
        latest <code>LastModifiedDate</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>First Record</strong> - Based on a custom sort order using the 
        <strong>Matched Records Sorting Components</strong> field, where DSP 
        formulas define sorting logic.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Special Case: DuplicateRecordItem Matching</strong><br />
      When using <strong>DuplicateRecordItem</strong> as the matching object, 
      DSP allows principal record selection at:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>DuplicateRecordItem</strong> level (default)</li>
      <li>The actual duplicate object (e.g., <code>Account</code>, <code>Lead</code>) 
      by specifying the API name in the 
      <strong>Duplicate Record Object API Name</strong> field.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This approach ensures merges are precise, configurable, and aligned 
      with business logic.
