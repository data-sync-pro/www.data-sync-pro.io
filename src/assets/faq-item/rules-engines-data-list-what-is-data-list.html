<p>A #Data List is derived from a single SOQL query yet goes far beyond a traditional datatableâ€”supporting complex queries, full CRUD operations, inline editing, pagination, column filters, query builder, and both built-in and declarative custom actions on selected records. Natively integrated with Lightning App Builder, it can be placed directly on pages for seamless use. Its flexible configuration over functionality, security, user interface, and interactivity makes it a powerful interactive datatable for managing and acting on records.</p>
