<p>An <b>#Action Button</b> is created as an Executable, either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Direction-Based</strong> for record actions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Connection-Based</strong> for global actions</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once created, DSP provides a guided interface—covering steps like
  <strong>Scoping</strong>, <strong>Match</strong>, <strong>Mapping</strong>, and <strong>Action</strong>, along with additional
  <em>Action on Target</em> settings—to configure the button into a powerful,
  reusable action.
</p>
<p>
  To <strong>add</strong> an #Action Button on a record page, place the LWC
  <strong>“Executable Action Button”</strong> or
  <strong>“Pipeline Action Buttons”</strong> in Lightning App Builder and
  provide the Executable API Name or Pipeline API Name.
</p>
<p>
  To use it as a <strong>Quick Action</strong>, create a Quick Action from the
  Source Object’s <em>Buttons, Links, and Actions</em> setup, choose
  <strong>Lightning Web Component</strong> as the Action Type, select
  <code>pushtopics:executableQuickAction</code>, and set the Executable API Name
  as the Name.
