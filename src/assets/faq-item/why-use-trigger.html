  DSP <b>#Trigger</b> is a <b>bulkified</b>, <b>rules-driven</b>, <b>modular</b> engine
  that simplifies Salesforce automation and validation. Instead of writing
  cumbersome bulkification code, you configure #Trigger Executable records
  <b>declaratively</b>. This makes automation simple to design, implement,
  maintain and scale.
</p>
<p><strong>Key Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Rules-Driven Trigger Logic</strong><br />
      Define trigger rules declaratively with formulas and expressions. #Trigger
      logic is modular, metadata-driven, and injected dynamically at runtime.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Bulkified by Design</strong><br />DSP automatically manages bulk
      processing so you can define rules as if working with a single record. You
      can directly reference fields on parent objects (e.g.,
      <code>Parent__r.GrandParent__r.Field__c</code>) and use advanced functions
      like <code>VLOOKUP</code> or <code>AGG</code>, making even complex
      transformations straightforwardâ€”without writing custom SOQL or handling
      Apex collections.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Dynamic Scoping and Criteria</strong><br />
      Triggered records are evaluated against scoping rules so only the relevant
      subset is processed, improving efficiency and precision.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Flexible Actions</strong><br />
      Executables can perform validations, recalculate fields, insert, update,
      or delete related records, send notifications, publish platform events or
      more.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Execution Order and Control</strong><br />
      DSP gives administrators fine-grained control over execution order,
      selective bypass options, recursion handling, and user-level permissions,
      ensuring flexible configurations that address even complex business
      requirements in enterprise environments.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By combining a <strong>rules-driven framework</strong>,
  <strong>bulkified execution</strong>, and
  <strong>metadata-driven injection</strong>, #Trigger makes Salesforce
  automation and validation far more scalable, flexible, and maintainable, while
  reducing complexity and <b>significantly</b>
  <b>minimizing long-term technical debt</b>.
