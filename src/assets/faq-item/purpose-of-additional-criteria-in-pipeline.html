<p>It defines a shared SOQL filter applied to all Executables in the Pipeline. This ensures consistent data retrieval while letting each Executable add its own filters.</p><p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>Standardizes data retrieval across Executables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduces redundancy by avoiding repeated filters</p></li>
</ul><p><strong>Tip:</strong> When editing an Executable's Retrieve query, temporarily remove the shared criteria, make your changes, then reapply it to avoid conflicts.</p>
