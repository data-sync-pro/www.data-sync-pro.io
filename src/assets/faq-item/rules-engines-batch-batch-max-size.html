  <p>
  The maximum batch size in Data Sync Pro (DSP) is <strong>2,000
  records</strong> per batch. For <strong>remote</strong> Connections - to
  set the batch size to 2,000, "<strong>Action to Bulk API</strong>" must be
  <strong>enabled</strong>, as Salesforce's regular API does not support DML operations with more
  than 200 records per request.
