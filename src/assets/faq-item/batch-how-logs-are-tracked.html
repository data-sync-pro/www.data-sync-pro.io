    Data Sync Pro tracks batch logs using structured records and
    optional file-based logging:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Execution</strong> - One per batch job run, linked to the Executable.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Batch Execution</strong> - One per batch within the job, linked to the parent Execution record. If "<b>Log to File</b>" is enabled, additional details are stored as a JSON ContentDocument, linked to the Batch Execution record.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pipeline Execution (if applicable)</strong> - When run from a Pipeline, a Pipeline Execution record is created, and the related Execution records are assigned sequence numbers.</li></ul><p>This structure enables complete tracking, auditing, and troubleshooting of batch processes.</p>
