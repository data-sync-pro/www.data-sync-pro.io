      A batch job is a method of processing large volumes of data or tasks by breaking them 
      into smaller, manageable units (or "batches") that are executed asynchronously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Batch jobs are not limited to local data processing—they apply to any process that 
      <strong>retrieves data</strong> from a source, applies <strong>transformations</strong>, 
      and performs actions on a target, whether <strong>within a single system</strong> or <strong>across 
      connected systems</strong>.

    <p><strong>Core Concepts:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Asynchronous Processing</strong><br />
        Batch jobs run separately from the main application flow, allowing intensive operations to execute 
        without impacting system responsiveness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Chunking</strong><br />
        Large datasets are split into smaller batches, each processed independently. This improves efficiency, 
        scalability, and fault tolerance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Invocation</strong><br />
        Batch jobs can be triggered on-demand, scheduled, or initiated by other automated processes, depending 
        on platform capabilities and business needs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Common Use Cases:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mass data updates, inserts, or deletions</li>
      <li>Data cleansing, enrichment, and deduplication</li>
      <li>Cross-org or cross-system data synchronization</li>
      <li>Backup and restore of historical records</li>
      <li>Lead conversion</li>
      <li>Sending emails or triggering custom notifications</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Batch jobs are widely used across enterprise platforms to enable 
      <strong>efficient</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong>, and <strong>reliable</strong> processing of 
      high-volume data operations—locally or across systems.
