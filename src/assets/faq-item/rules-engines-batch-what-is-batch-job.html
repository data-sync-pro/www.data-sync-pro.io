<p><strong>A batch job</strong> is a method of processing large volumes of data or tasks by dividing them into smaller, manageable units (“batches”) that run asynchronously.</p><p>Batch jobs are not limited to local data—they apply to any process that retrieves from a source, applies transformations, and performs actions on a target, whether within a single system or across connected systems.</p><p><strong>Core Concepts</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asynchronous Processing</strong> – Runs separately from the main application flow so heavy operations don’t impact responsiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Chunking</strong> – Breaks large datasets into smaller batches for efficiency, scalability, and fault tolerance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Invocation</strong> – Can be scheduled, run on demand, or triggered by other automated processes, depending on platform capabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>



</p><p><strong>In short:</strong> Batch jobs are a cornerstone of enterprise computing—powering efficient, scalable, and reliable high-volume processing both locally and across systems.</p>
