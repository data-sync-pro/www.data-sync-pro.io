  No. Splitting a batch job into modular, rules-driven Executables improves
  clarity and maintainability without materially affecting performance. Runtime
  is driven by the number of DML operations executed and the automation those
  DMLs invoke (Flows, Triggers, Processes), not by whether logic runs in one
  batch or multiple Executables.

  <strong>Benchmark (same workload, three implementations)</strong><br />
  Each implementation retrieves 30k Accounts, then updates those Accounts 3
  times per batch (no field changes), with all automation disabled.
