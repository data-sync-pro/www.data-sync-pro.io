      A <strong>Scope Filter</strong> in Data Sync Pro (DSP) is a formula-based 
      condition used during the <strong>Scoping</strong> step to determine 
      which source records should proceed through execution. Scope Filters 
      can either:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Evaluate to <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> to include 
      or exclude records, or</li>
      <li>Raise a <strong>conditional error</strong> using the 
      <code>ERROR()</code> function when validation criteria are met.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Scope Filters are <strong>evaluated sequentially</strong>, allowing 
      for layered, modular filtering logic based on context:

    <h3>üß© <strong>Sequential Scope Filter Layers</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        1Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pipeline Scope Filter</strong><br />
        Applied when the Executable runs as part of a Pipeline. It acts as a 
        global pre-filter to control record scope across all Executables in 
        the Pipeline.
      </li>
      <li>
        2Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Executable Scope Filter</strong><br />
        Defines the core scoping condition for the individual Executable‚Äîevaluated 
        whether the Executable runs standalone or within a Pipeline.
      </li>
      <li>
        3Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Trigger Scope Filters</strong><br />
        Used specifically in <strong>Trigger Executables</strong>, these filters 
        apply to defined trigger events (e.g., *Before Insert*, *After Update*) 
        and allow further control through event-specific logic like 
        *Scope Filter (Before Update Trigger)*.
      </li>
      <li>
        4Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Scope Filter (Post Join)</strong><br />
        Evaluated after the <strong>Join</strong> step, this filter enables 
        additional refinement of the enriched source dataset.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      üìå <strong>Scope Filters</strong> provide precise and layered control, 
      ensuring only relevant records proceed while allowing validation 
      and filtering at multiple stages.
