      You can create a Variable record from an Executableâ€™s related list, 
      assigning it a name and a corresponding formula. Variables improve the 
      readability of complex formulas and enhance reusability. A global Variable 
      is shared across multiple Executables, while a local Variable is reusable 
      only within the same Executable.
