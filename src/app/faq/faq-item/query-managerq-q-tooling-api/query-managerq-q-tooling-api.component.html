      Yes, Q supports querying via the Tooling API. Users can switch to 
      <strong>Tooling API Mode</strong> to query metadata and system-related 
      objects that are not accessible through standard SOQLâ€”enabling retrieval 
      of Apex classes, triggers, custom fields, debug logs, and other 
      development components.
