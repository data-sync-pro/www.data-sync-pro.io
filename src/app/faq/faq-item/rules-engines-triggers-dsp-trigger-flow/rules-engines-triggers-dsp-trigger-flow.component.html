      When a record is inserted, updated, deleted, or undeleted in Salesforce, 
      DSP follows a structured execution process to enable bulkified, rule-based 
      automation:
    </p>
    <pre><code>Trigger Event Detection → Scoping → Match → Mapping → Action
  </code></pre>
    <p>
      This ensures that trigger actions and transformations are efficiently processed 
      while maintaining scalability and performance.
