      The <strong>Batch, Data List</strong>, and <strong>Trigger</strong> rules engines in DSP 
      are <strong>Direction-based</strong>, meaning they take input from a source object, apply 
      transformations, and perform an action on a target object. The <strong>Data Loader</strong> 
      is similar to Batch but is <strong>Connection-based</strong>, meaning its source data comes 
      from a CSV upload rather than a source object. The <strong>Action Button</strong> can be either 
      Direction-based or Connection-based:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Connection-based Action Button</strong> &ndash; Acts as a global action 
        with no input data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Direction-based Action Button</strong> &ndash; Functions as a record action, 
        using the current record from a Lightning record page as input.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      While these rules engines share similar sub-processes, the key difference lies 
      in how they receive input:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Batch</strong> &ndash; Processes all records retrieved by the <em>Retrieve</em> query.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data List</strong> &ndash; Displays query results to users, allowing manual record 
        selection before execution.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Triggers</strong> &ndash; Executes when Salesforce DML events occur, using the 
        triggering records as input.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Action Button</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Connection-based:</strong> No input data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Direction-based:</strong> Uses the current record from the Lightning record page.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Loader</strong> &ndash; Uses uploaded CSV data as input instead of querying a 
        source object.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      <strong>ðŸ“Œ Note:</strong> Despite their differences in input handling, all DSP rules engines follow a 
      structured process, enabling powerful automation and transformation capabilities.
