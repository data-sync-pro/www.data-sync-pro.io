    <p>Grouping Executable Data Lists into a <strong>Pipeline</strong> offers 
      several key benefits:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        1️⃣ <strong>Organized UI with Variant Options</strong><br />
        The <strong>Pipeline Data Lists</strong> component can be placed on 
        a Lightning page to display multiple Data Lists using different 
        <strong>variants</strong>—including <strong>stack</strong>, 
        <strong>tabs</strong>, and <strong>list-views</strong>—giving 
        designers control over how data is presented and navigated.
      </li>
      <li>
        2️⃣ <strong>Flexible Configuration &amp; Maintenance</strong><br />
        You can <strong>add, remove, reorder, or modify</strong> Executable 
        Data Lists directly within the Pipeline—without changing the 
        Lightning page—making updates easier to manage.
      </li>
      <li>
        3️⃣ <strong>Merged Actions for Shared Queries</strong><br />
        If multiple Data Lists in the Pipeline use the same 
        <strong>source query</strong>, their actions are automatically 
        <strong>merged into a single list</strong>, providing users with a 
        unified interface.
      </li>
    </ol>

      📌 <strong>Pipelines bring structure, flexibility, and modularity—making it 
      easier to manage and present multiple related Data Lists in one place.</strong>
