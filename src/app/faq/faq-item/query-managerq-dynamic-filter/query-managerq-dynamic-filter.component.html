    A dynamic filter in Data Sync Pro allows query filters to
   <strong>adjust automatically</strong> based on a <strong>record context</strong> or the
    <strong>current user</strong>, using
    <strong>custom Apex code (low-code)</strong> where needed. This enables
    context-aware queries that dynamically respond to field values from a
    specified record, adapt to the attributes of the logged-in user, or execute
    fully customized logic.

  <h3>### ðŸ”„ <strong>How It Works</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Record-Based Filters</strong> Dynamic filters can reference fields
      on a record using the syntax <code>:FieldName</code>, including relational
      fields (e.g., <code>:Account.OwnerId</code>). In
      Query Builder, enter a
      static Context Record ID to enable and test these filters
      while building the query. When used on a
      Lightning Record Page, the current record automatically
      becomes the contextâ€”updating the query dynamically at runtime.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>User-Based Filters</strong> Use built-in tokens like
      <code>:$User.Id</code>, <code>:$User.DirectReports</code>,
      <code>:$User.Team</code>, or <code>:$UserRole.Team</code> to adapt filters
      based on the logged-in user. These are typically used in filters on
      reference fields that point to the User object.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Custom Apex Logic (Low-Code)</strong> For advanced logic,
      implement the <code>DynamicFilterValue</code> interface in an Apex class
      and reference it using <code>:ApexClassName</code> in the filter.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    ðŸ“Œ Prefix all dynamic filters with a
    colon (<code>:</code>) to activate runtime evaluation.
