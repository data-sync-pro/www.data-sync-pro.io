    In <strong>Query Manager (Q)</strong>, hyperlinks are automatically applied
    to <strong>ID</strong>, <strong>Name</strong>, and
    <strong>Reference</strong> fields in the query results for quick access to
    related records.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      By default, clicking a hyperlink opens the
      <strong>Raw Record Page</strong>, which shows all field values, labels,
      API names, and data types. Users can filter fields, edit, delete, or clone
      the record.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <strong>"Open Links in Record Page"</strong> is enabled, hyperlinks
      open in the standard
      <strong>Salesforce Lightning Record Page</strong> instead.
    </li>
  </ul>
