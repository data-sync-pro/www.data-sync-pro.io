      In <strong>Query Manager (Q)</strong>, hyperlinks are automatically 
      applied to <strong>ID</strong>, <strong>Name</strong>, and 
      <strong>Reference</strong> fields in the query results for quick access.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        By default, clicking a hyperlink opens the <strong>Raw Record Page</strong>, 
        which shows all field values, labels, API names, and data types, with 
        options to edit, delete, or clone.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <strong>"Open Links in Record Page"</strong> is enabled, links open 
        the standard <strong>Lightning record page</strong> instead.
      </li>
    </ul>
