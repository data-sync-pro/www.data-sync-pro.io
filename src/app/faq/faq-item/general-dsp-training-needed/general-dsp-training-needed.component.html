    Getting started with Data Sync Pro requires <strong>minimal training</strong>. DSP is built
    entirely on <strong>Salesforce-native technologies</strong> (Apex and LWC) and introduces
    only <strong>seven intuitive configuration objects</strong>— Connection,
    Direction, Pipeline, Executable, Field Mapping, Variable, and Schedule—whose
    purposes are mostly self-explanatory by name.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Creating data processes in DSP simply involves
    creating records from these configuration objects, along
    with a <strong>one-time integration</strong> via Apex Triggers or Lightning
    Pages. Each rules engine comes with <strong>guided user interfaces</strong>,
    <strong>step-by-step configuration</strong>, and
    <strong>capability-based fields</strong>
    that help users design rules easily within Executable records.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    DSP provides <strong>autocomplete suggestions</strong> for filters, field
    mappings, and variables to simplify building formulas.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    To support new users, DSP also includes
    <strong>comprehensive user manuals</strong> and
    <strong>starter recipes</strong> to help teams ramp up quickly.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Thanks to its intuitive design and shared architecture across rules engines,
    most users are able to start building rules within <strong>a few hours</strong>.
