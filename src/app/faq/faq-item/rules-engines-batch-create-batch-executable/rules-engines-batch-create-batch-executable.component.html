    To define a Batch in Data Sync Pro (DSP), you begin by creating a
    <strong>Batch Executable</strong> that is associated with a
    <strong>Direction</strong>. This Executable can be created directly from a
    <strong>Direction record</strong> or from a
    <strong>Pipeline record</strong> with a
    <strong>Template Direction</strong> specified.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once created, DSP provides a
    <strong>guided</strong>, <strong>step-by-step interface</strong> for defining the Batch
    process:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>1️⃣ Retrieve</strong> &ndash; Configure how source data is queried
      from the connected org. Designers can
      <strong>preview data, test transformations</strong>, and run selected
      records before executing the full batch.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>2️⃣ Scoping</strong> &ndash; Refine the retrieved dataset using
      <strong>in-memory</strong> filters and optional joins with other datasets
      for multi-source enrichment.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>3️⃣ Match</strong> &ndash; Identify target records using matching
      rules. Supports <strong>insert-only</strong> logic,
      <strong>multi-field matching</strong> via transformations, and
      <strong>merge-specific</strong> logic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>4️⃣ Mapping</strong> &ndash; Apply formulas and expressions to
      assign and transform target field values. Features auto-validation,
      relational field support, and a comprehensive function library.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>5️⃣ Action</strong> &ndash; Define the operations to be performed,
      such as Insert, Update, Upsert, Delete, Merge, Lead Convert, Send Email,
      and more. Configure behavior options like <strong>&ldquo;Skip Record Update if No
      Changes&rdquo;</strong> and writeback.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>6️⃣ Verify</strong> &ndash; Select target fields to review after
      execution. These fields appear in the Batch Execution record, allowing
      review of source and target data side-by-side.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    In addition, the <strong>Batch Settings</strong> section allows
    configuration of execution parameters such as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Enabling <strong>Bulk API</strong></li>
    <li>Setting the <strong>batch size</strong></li>
    <li>Enabling <strong>auto-retry</strong> for failed batches</li>
    <li>Running in <strong>serial mode</strong></li>
    <li>Defining additional execution behaviors</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This structured, guided process ensures each Batch is <strong>configurable,
    repeatable, and optimized for high-performance, large-scale data
    operations</strong> &mdash; all within Salesforce’s native environment.
