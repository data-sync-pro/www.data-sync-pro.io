      To define a Batch in Data Sync Pro (DSP), you begin by creating a 
      <strong>Batch Executable</strong> that is associated with a <strong>Direction</strong>. 
      This Executable can be created directly from a <strong>Direction record</strong> or from a 
      <strong>Pipeline record</strong> with a <strong>Template Direction</strong> specified.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Once created, DSP provides a <strong>guided, step-by-step interface</strong> for defining 
      the Batch process:
    </p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>1Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve</strong> &ndash; Configure how source data is queried from the 
        connected org. Designers can preview data, test transformations, and run selected records 
        before executing the full batch.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2Ô∏è‚É£ Scoping</strong> &ndash; Refine the retrieved dataset using in-memory filters 
        and optional joins with other datasets for multi-source enrichment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3Ô∏è‚É£ Match</strong> &ndash; Identify target records using matching rules. Supports 
        insert-only logic, multi-field matching via transformations, and merge-specific logic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>4Ô∏è‚É£ Mapping</strong> &ndash; Apply formulas and expressions to assign and transform 
        target field values. Features auto-validation, relational field support, and a comprehensive 
        function library.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>5Ô∏è‚É£ Action</strong> &ndash; Define the operations to be performed, such as Insert, 
        Update, Upsert, Delete, Merge, Lead Convert, Send Email, and more. Configure behavior options 
        like &ldquo;Skip Record Update if No Changes&rdquo; and writeback.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>6Ô∏è‚É£ Verify</strong> &ndash; Select target fields to review after execution. These 
        fields appear in the Batch Execution record, allowing review of source and target data 
        side-by-side.
      </li>
    </ol>
  
    <p>
      In addition, the <strong>Batch Settings</strong> section allows configuration of execution 
      parameters such as:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Enabling <strong>Bulk API</strong></li>
      <li>Setting the <strong>batch size</strong></li>
      <li>Enabling <strong>auto-retry</strong> for failed batches</li>
      <li>Running in <strong>serial mode</strong></li>
      <li>Defining additional <strong>execution behaviors</strong></li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      üìå This structured, guided process ensures each Batch is configurable, repeatable, and optimized 
      for high-performance, large-scale data operations&mdash;all within Salesforce‚Äôs native environment.
