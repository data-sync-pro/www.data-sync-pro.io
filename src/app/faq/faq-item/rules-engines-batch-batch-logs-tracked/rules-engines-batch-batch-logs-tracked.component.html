    Data Sync Pro tracks Batch execution logs using structured records and
    optional file-based logging:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Execution Records</strong> – For each batch job run, an Execution
      record is created and linked to the original Executable record.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Batch Execution Records</strong> – Each individual batch within
      the job generates a Batch Execution record, linked to the parent Execution
      record.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Log to File (Optional)</strong> – If
      <strong>"Log to File"</strong> is enabled, additional execution details
      are saved in <strong>JSON format</strong> as a
      <strong>ContentDocument</strong>, linked to the corresponding Batch
      Execution record.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pipeline Execution (if applicable)</strong> – When the batch job
      runs as part of a Pipeline, a Pipeline Execution record is created. The
      related Execution records within the pipeline are automatically assigned
      <strong>sequence numbers</strong> to indicate their order.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    📌 This logging structure enables <strong>detailed tracking, auditing</strong>, and
    <strong>troubleshooting</strong> for every step of the batch process.
