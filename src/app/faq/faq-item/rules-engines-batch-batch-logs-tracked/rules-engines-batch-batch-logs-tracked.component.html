      Data Sync Pro tracks Batch execution logs using structured records and optional file-based logging:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Execution Records</strong> â€“ For each batch job run, an 
        <strong>Execution</strong> record is created and linked to the original 
        <strong>Executable</strong> record.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Batch Execution Records</strong> â€“ Each individual batch within the job 
        generates a <strong>Batch Execution</strong> record, linked to the parent Execution record.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Log to File (Optional)</strong> â€“ If <strong>"Log to File"</strong> is enabled, 
        additional execution details are saved in <strong>JSON format</strong> as a 
        <strong>ContentDocument</strong>, linked to the corresponding Batch Execution record.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pipeline Execution (if applicable)</strong> â€“ When the batch job runs as part of 
        a <strong>Pipeline</strong>, a <strong>Pipeline Execution</strong> record is created. 
        The related Execution records within the pipeline are automatically assigned 
        <strong>sequence numbers</strong> to indicate their order.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      ðŸ“Œ This logging structure enables detailed tracking, auditing, and troubleshooting for 
      every step of the batch process.
