      "Enable <strong>""Q: Query Manager Toggleable?""</strong> on the Data List Executable 
      to give users access to the <strong>Query Manager (Q)</strong>â€”an intuitive UI that 
      allows them to <strong>select fields, adjust filters, and apply sorting</strong> 
      as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      DSPâ€™s Query Manager lists all <strong>selectable and orderable fields</strong>, 
      including fields from <strong>parent relationships</strong>, and provides 
      <strong>autocomplete hints</strong> for filter operators and valuesâ€”tailored to 
      the field type (e.g., picklists, date/datetime, reference fields, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      ðŸ“Œ To simplify the interface, enable <strong>""Q: Hide Others in Query Manager?""</strong> 
      to hide the <strong>""Other""</strong> section for a more focused user experience."
