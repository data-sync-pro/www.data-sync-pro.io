    Data Sync Pro supports three core user personas, each defined by a dedicated permission set 
    that controls access to DSP features and actions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro Starter</strong><br />
      Provides minimal access to DSP package objects and components. Users with this permission 
      set can execute <strong>synchronous rules</strong> like <strong>Triggers</strong>, 
      <strong>Record Actions</strong>, and <strong>Data Lists</strong>â€”<strong>only if Read 
      access to the associated Executable records is shared with them</strong>. They 
      <strong>cannot execute Batch Jobs or Data Loaders</strong>, even if they have access to the 
      related Executable records.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro App User</strong><br />
      Builds on the Starter persona by granting access to the 
      <strong>Data Sync Pro</strong> app, as well as the ability to 
      <strong>execute Batch Jobs and Data Loaders</strong>, provided the user has at least 
      <strong>Read access to the relevant Executable records</strong> through sharing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro Administrator</strong><br />
      Grants full administrative access, including <strong>"Modify All"</strong> on all DSP 
      objects and access to <strong>all custom permissions</strong> within the package. This 
      persona is intended for users responsible for configuring and managing DSP across the org.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These permission sets enable secure, scalable, and role-appropriate access control throughout 
    your use of Data Sync Pro.
