      Serial mode should be used when processing records sequentially is necessary 
      to prevent record locking issues, ensure data integrity, or maintain the 
      correct execution order. It is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple 
      records update the same parent record or when actions depend on the completion 
      of previous records.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Considerations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prevents Record Locking</strong> â€“ Reduces the likelihood of lock
          contention, especially when updating or inserting related records.</li>
    
      <li><strong>Ensures Order of Execution</strong> â€“ Processes records one at a
          time rather than in parallel, which is beneficial for workflows that require
          strict sequencing.</li>
    
      <li><strong>Potential Performance Impact</strong> â€“ Since records are processed
          sequentially, execution time may increase compared to parallel processing.</li>
    
      <li><strong>Use for Dependent Transactions</strong> â€“ Ideal when data dependencies
          exist between records that must be processed in a specific order.</li>
    </ul>    
    <p>
      Enabling <strong>serial mode</strong> ensures safer execution in these cases, 
      but it should be used selectively based on the needs of the batch process. ðŸš€
