  You can use the Migration Builder within the Pipeline to set up Batch Executables for syncing 
  multiple objects. Start by creating a Pipeline record with a template direction, then navigate 
  to the Migration Builder tab. Add root objects, expand each root object down to the leaf node 
  you want to sync, and select the leaf node. In the modal popup, choose the source and target 
  fields for matching, define the action, and click Create Executables to generate the necessary 
  batch processes.
