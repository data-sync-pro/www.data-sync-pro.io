    Bulkified transformation simplifies data processing across various DSP rules
    enginesâ€”such as Trigger, Batch, Data List, and Data Loaderâ€”by automatically
    managing bulk operations. This significantly reduces complexity, leading to
    clearer, more modular logic.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, in standard Apex development, referencing related or parent
    fields requires manual bulkification steps:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Querying all related parent records.</li>
    <li>Storing these results in Map collections.</li>
    <li>Iterating through each record to retrieve values using keys.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    DSPâ€™s bulkified transformation automates these complexities. You simply
    reference fields directlyâ€”such as <code>Parent__r.Field_x__c</code>â€”and DSP
    automatically handles bulk queries, data retrieval, and collection
    management behind the scenes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, DSP bulkifies advanced functions such as
    <strong>VLOOKUP</strong>
    and AGG-family functions by intelligently optimizing and consolidating
    queries. When multiple functions reference similar datasets, DSP constructs
    a consolidated query whenever possible, further enhancing performance and
    simplicity.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Key Benefits:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Simplicity</strong>: You define rules in DSP's no-code engines by
      using declarative fields (including relational fields), formulas, and
      expressionsâ€”just as if working with a single recordâ€”while DSP manages the
      bulk data operations automatically.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Performance</strong>: Automatically optimized and consolidated
      queries significantly reduce database interactions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Modularity</strong>: Clear separation of business logic from
      technical execution details enhances reusability and ease of maintenance.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    ðŸš€ By automating bulkification across various engines and advanced
    functions, DSP significantly simplifies data transformation logic, enhances
    efficiency, and enables scalable, modular designs.
