      **A:** The <strong>Retrieve</strong> step in Data Sync Pro (DSP) defines 
      how source data is queried from a connected Salesforce org. It serves as 
      the entry point for record selection in both <strong>Batches</strong> and 
      <strong>Data Lists</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      - <strong>In Batches:</strong> Retrieve specifies the source records used 
      during batch executionâ€”similar to the data returned by the 
      <code>start()</code> method in Salesforceâ€™s 
      <code>Database.Batchable</code> interface.<br />
      - <strong>In Data Lists:</strong> Retrieve defines the SOQL query used 
      to display records to users in the UI.
    </p>
    <p>
      At runtime, DSP automatically fetches only the fields required by 
      downstream stepsâ€”<strong>Scoping, Match, and Mapping</strong>â€”based on 
      actual usage. The fields selected in the Retrieve query are used only 
      for <strong>preview and display purposes</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      ðŸ“Œ Retrieve enables intuitive query configuration while DSP intelligently 
      fetches only whatâ€™s needed for efficient execution.
