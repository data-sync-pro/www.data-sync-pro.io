    Yes, changes made by a Batch execution can be reverted depending on the
    action type and configuration. DSP provides flexible rollback options when
    needed:

  <h3>üîÑ For Update Actions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If <strong>"Log to File"</strong> is enabled, the original target data is
      saved as a <strong>JSON log file</strong> before the update.
    </li>

    <li>
      To revert updates:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use <strong>"Restore Updated From Log File"</strong> on the
          Batch Execution or Execution record.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>‚ûï For Insert Actions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      To remove inserted records:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Click <strong>"Delete Inserted Records"</strong> from the
          Execution record to delete all records inserted by
          the job.
        </li>
        <li>
          To delete records from a specific batch, go to the
          Batch Execution record, open the
          <strong>Verify</strong> tab, and delete directly from the data list.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üóëÔ∏è For Delete Actions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use <strong>"Restore From Recycle Bin"</strong> if the records are still
      available there.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <strong>"Log to File"</strong> is enabled:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use <strong>"Re-Create Deleted From Log File"</strong> on the
          Batch Execution to restore deleted data from the
          saved log.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Reversion is <strong>not supported</strong> when
    <strong>"Action to Bulk API"</strong> is enabled.

    These rollback features help ensure reliable recovery from unintended
    changes‚Äîwhether from updates, inserts, or deletions‚Äîsupporting safer data
    operations in DSP.
