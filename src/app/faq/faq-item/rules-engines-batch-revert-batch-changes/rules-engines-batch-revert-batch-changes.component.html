      Yes, changes made by a Batch execution can be reverted depending on the action type 
      and configuration. DSP provides flexible rollback options when needed:

    <h4>üîÑ <strong>For Update Actions</strong></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If <strong>"Log to File"</strong> is enabled, the original target data is saved 
        as a <strong>JSON log file</strong> before the update.
      </li>
      <li>
        To revert updates:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use <strong>"Restore Updated From Log File"</strong> on the <strong>Batch Execution</strong> 
            or <strong>Execution</strong> record.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>‚ûï <strong>For Insert Actions</strong></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To remove inserted records:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Click <strong>"Delete Inserted Records"</strong> from the <strong>Execution</strong> record 
            to delete all records inserted by the job.
          </li>
          <li>
            To delete records from a specific batch, go to the 
            <strong>Batch Execution</strong> record, open the <strong>Verify</strong> tab, and delete 
            directly from the data list.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>üóëÔ∏è <strong>For Delete Actions</strong></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use <strong>"Restore From Recycle Bin"</strong> if the records are still available there.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <strong>"Log to File"</strong> is enabled:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use <strong>"Re-Create Deleted From Log File"</strong> on the 
            <strong>Batch Execution</strong> to restore deleted data from the saved log.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <hr />
  
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Reversion is <strong>not supported</strong> when 
      <strong>"Action to Bulk API"</strong> is enabled.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      These rollback features help ensure reliable recovery from unintended changes‚Äîwhether 
      from updates, inserts, or deletions‚Äîsupporting safer data operations in DSP.
