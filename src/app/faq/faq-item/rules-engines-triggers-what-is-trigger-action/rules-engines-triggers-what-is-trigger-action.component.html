      A <strong>Trigger Action</strong> in DSP is a rule-based automation that 
      executes specific actions when a record meets defined criteria during a 
      Salesforce trigger event (e.g., Before Insert, After Update). Unlike 
      Self-Adaptive Triggers, which modify and validate fields within the 
      same record, Trigger Actions use the triggering records as a source 
      to perform separate operations on related or different records.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a trigger event occurs, DSP evaluates Scope Filters to determine 
      which records qualify for execution. Once matched, a Trigger Action can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Update related records</li>
      <li>Create new records</li>
      <li>Send notifications (email or in-app bell notifications)</li>
      <li>Publish Platform Events</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      DSP automatically bulkifies Trigger Actions and prevents recursion, ensuring 
      efficient execution across large data volumesâ€”without requiring Apex development.
