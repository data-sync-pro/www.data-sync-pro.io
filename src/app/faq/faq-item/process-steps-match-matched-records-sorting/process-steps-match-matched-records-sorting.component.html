      The "Matched Records Sorting Components" field defines the 
      sorting logic for matched target records when multiple records are found. 
      It consists of semicolon-separated expressions that compare and sort 
      records in ascending order by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sort in descending order, prefix an expression with a negative sign 
      (<code>-</code>). For example:<br />
      <code>-LEN(Description) ; -LastModifiedDate</code><br />
      This sorts matched records first by <code>Description</code> length (DESC), 
      and if lengths are the same, by <code>LastModifiedDate</code> (DESC).
    </p>
    <p>
      For Boolean values, TRUE is considered smaller than FALSE.
