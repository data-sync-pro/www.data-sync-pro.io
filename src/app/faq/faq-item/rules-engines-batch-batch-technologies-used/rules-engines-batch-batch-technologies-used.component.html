    Batch in Data Sync Pro (DSP) is built entirely with Apex (on the backend) and Lightning Web Components (LWC) (on the frontend), 
    ensuring secure, Salesforce-native data processing that never leaves the subscriber’s org. Unlike traditional Apex batch classes, 
    DSP’s no-code Batch uses an optimized execution framework to handle large-scale data operations faster and more efficiently.
