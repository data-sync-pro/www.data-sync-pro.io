      A <strong>batch job</strong> is a method of processing large volumes of data or tasks by breaking them 
      into smaller, manageable units (or ‚Äúbatches‚Äù) that are executed asynchronously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Batch jobs are not limited to local data processing‚Äîthey apply to any process that 
      <strong>retrieves data from a source</strong>, applies <strong>transformations</strong>, 
      and performs <strong>actions on a target</strong>, whether within a single system or across 
      connected systems.

    <h3>üîß <strong>Core Concepts:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Asynchronous Processing</strong><br />
        Batch jobs run separately from the main application flow, allowing intensive operations to execute 
        without impacting system responsiveness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Chunking</strong><br />
        Large datasets are split into smaller batches, each processed independently. This improves efficiency, 
        scalability, and fault tolerance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Invocation</strong><br />
        Batch jobs can be triggered on-demand, scheduled, or initiated by other automated processes, depending 
        on platform capabilities and business needs.
      </li>

    <h3>üìå <strong>Common Use Cases:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mass data updates, inserts, or deletions</li>
      <li>Data cleansing, enrichment, and deduplication</li>
      <li>Cross-org or cross-system data synchronization</li>
      <li>Backup and restore of historical records</li>
      <li>Lead conversion</li>
      <li>Sending emails or triggering custom notifications</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Batch jobs are widely used across enterprise platforms to enable 
      <strong>efficient, scalable, and reliable</strong> processing of high-volume data operations‚Äîlocally 
      or across systems.
