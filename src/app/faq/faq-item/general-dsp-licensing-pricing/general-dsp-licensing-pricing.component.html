      Data Sync Pro uses a <strong>site-wide license model</strong>, meaning it can be assigned
      to <strong>unlimited users</strong> within your Salesforce org. This allows you to maximize
      value across teams without incurring per-user (per-seat) costs.
    </p>
  
    <p>Pricing is based on three key factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Number of Connections</strong> – The number of external Salesforce orgs or 
        environments connected through DSP.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Number of Executables</strong> – The number of rules or logic units created in 
        DSP to define data operations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Daily Data Volume</strong> – The total amount of data DSP processes each day.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      This model ensures you're paying for the <strong>value delivered</strong>—based on the scale 
      and complexity of your data management needs—not the number of users accessing the app.
