      You can simplify a complex batch job by breaking it into smaller, modular components 
      using one of the following approaches:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Use Multiple Executables within a Pipeline</strong><br />
        Split the batch logic across multiple <strong>Executables</strong>, each handling 
        a specific part of the process, and group them within a <strong>Pipeline</strong>. 
        Since <strong>batching in DSP is fast</strong> and most of the 
        <strong>performance cost occurs at the DML operations</strong>, this approach ensures 
        <strong>efficiency without significant overhead</strong>, even when breaking a large 
        job into smaller, modular batches.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Leverage Triggers for Sequential Actions</strong><br />
        If multiple actions can be initiated by a single DML on a primary object, consider 
        using <strong>DSP Triggers</strong> to orchestrate the sequence. <br />
        For example: <em>update the primary object to kick off a chain of automations sequentially.</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      This modular strategy improves clarity, supports reusability, simplifies testing, and 
      makes ongoing maintenance more scalable.
