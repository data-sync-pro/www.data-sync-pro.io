  <p><strong>Data Sync Pro ensures security and privacy in two key ways:</strong></p>

  <h3>1️⃣ Data Processing within the Subscriber’s Org</h3>
  <p>
    All data processing is performed entirely within the subscriber’s Salesforce org where DSP
    is installed, using native Apex. DSP operates fully within the subscriber’s environment and
    does not rely on any external data processing.
  </p>

  <h3>2️⃣ Enforcement of Salesforce’s Standard Security Model</h3>
  <p>
    DSP fully adheres to Salesforce’s object, field, and record-level security. Only users with
    the appropriate permissions can access or invoke DSP rules:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Users with the "<strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro Starter</strong>" permission set can access
      real-time (synchronous) rules—such as <strong>Data Lists</strong>, <strong>Triggers</strong>,
      and <strong>Action Buttons</strong>—only if they have read access to the associated
      Executable records.
    </li>
    <li>
      They cannot execute asynchronous rules, like <strong>Batch jobs</strong> or
      <strong>Data Loaders</strong>, as this permission set does not include insert access to
      <strong>Pipeline Execution</strong>, <strong>Execution</strong>, or
      <strong>Batch Execution</strong> objects required for logging.
    </li>
    <li>
      To run asynchronous rules, users must have the "<strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro App User</strong>"
      permission set and must be granted explicit access to the relevant Executable records.
    </li>
    <li>
      Full administrative control is reserved for users with the
      "<strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro Administrator</strong>" permission set, which includes access to
      all configuration records.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <p>
    <strong>These safeguards ensure that all DSP operations strictly follow the subscriber’s
    security settings while maintaining full control within the Salesforce platform.</strong>
