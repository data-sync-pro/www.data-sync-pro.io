      Execution logs in a Data Loader process are recorded as related records in DSP 
      for detailed tracking, troubleshooting, and compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each <strong>Execution</strong> record is associated with the Data Loader 
      Executable and captures key details such as execution status, processed records, 
      errors, and timestamps. Within each execution, 
      <strong>Batch Execution</strong> records are created as related records, 
      providing granular visibility into individual batch runs.

      This structured logging approach ensures transparency, making it easy to review, 
      analyze, and troubleshoot data loads efficiently.
