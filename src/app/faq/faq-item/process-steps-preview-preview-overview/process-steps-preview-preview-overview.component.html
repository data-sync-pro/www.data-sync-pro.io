      Preview functions similarly to Retrieve, as both execute a SOQL query 
      to fetch source data. However, they serve different purposes based on 
      the rules engine in use:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        1️⃣ <strong>Retrieve</strong> is used in <strong>Batch</strong> and 
        <strong>Data List</strong> to define and filter the source data 
        during execution. It determines which records will be processed 
        in the operation.
      </li>
      <li>
        2️⃣ <strong>Preview</strong> is used in <strong>Triggers</strong> 
        and <strong>Action Buttons</strong>, but it does not influence 
        the input data:
        <ul>
          <li>
            In <strong>Triggers</strong>, the input data comes from the 
            triggering context (i.e., the records being inserted, updated, 
            or deleted).
          </li>
          <li>
            In <strong>Action Buttons</strong>, the input data comes from 
            the loaded record in the Lightning Record Page.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        3️⃣ Both Retrieve and Preview allow users to view source records 
        and preview transformed values before execution, helping validate 
        the data and transformations applied.
      </li>
    </ol>
