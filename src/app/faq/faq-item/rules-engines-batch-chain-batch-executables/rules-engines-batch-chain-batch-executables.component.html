<p>
    To execute multiple Batch Executables in a specific order, create a Pipeline and associate the 
    Executables with it, assigning a Seq No based on their dependencies.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When the Pipeline is executed, it executes Batch Executables sequentially, ensuring each one runs 
    in the defined order.
