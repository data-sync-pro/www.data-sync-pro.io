    Salesforce requires at least one line of code in an Apex Trigger be covered
    by an Apex test class before deployment to production.
  </p>
  <p>
    For triggers integrated with <strong>Data Sync Pro (DSP)</strong>, each
    trigger contains a single line:
  </p>
  <code>pushtopics.TriggerServices.execute();</code>

  <p>
    To satisfy this requirement, write an Apex test that performs a DML
    operation (such as an insert or update) on the triggering object. This will
    invoke the trigger and ensure the line is covered.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the object has complex automation or dependencies, consider writing
    dedicated Apex test classes to ensure expected behavior is fully verified.
