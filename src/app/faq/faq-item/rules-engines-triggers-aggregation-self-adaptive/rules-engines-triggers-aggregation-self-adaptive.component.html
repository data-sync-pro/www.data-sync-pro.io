      In a Self-Adaptive Trigger Executable, navigate to the <strong>Mappings</strong> 
      tab and use <strong>AGG</strong> functions from the formula library to perform 
      aggregation calculations.

      <em>Note</em>: AGG functions can compute aggregations even from objects 
      without a direct relationship to the current object.
