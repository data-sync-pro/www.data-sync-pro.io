      The default <strong>New Record</strong> action in a Data List uses 
      Salesforceâ€™s standard <strong>LWC API</strong> to create a new record, 
      which opens a blank form based on the page layout. After saving, users 
      must manually refresh the Data List to view the new record.
    </p>
    <p>
      By replacing this with a <strong>global Executable Action Button</strong>â€”configured 
      via the <strong>"Q: New Record Executable API Name"</strong> fieldâ€”Data Sync 
      Pro offers a more streamlined and customizable experience:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>âœ… <strong>Pre-filled Forms</strong> â€“ Use DSP transformations to populate fields with relevant values.</li>
      <li>âœ… <strong>Editable Before Save</strong> â€“ Users can adjust the pre-filled values before submitting.</li>
      <li>âœ… <strong>Automatic Refresh</strong> â€“ The Data List refreshes automatically after record creation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ðŸ“Œ This approach provides a more <strong>convenient</strong>, 
      <strong>transformation-powered</strong> alternative to standard record 
      creation, supporting streamlined customization and better user flow.
