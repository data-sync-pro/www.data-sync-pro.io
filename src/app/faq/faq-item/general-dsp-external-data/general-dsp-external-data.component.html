    <strong>No, Data Sync Pro does not process any data outside the subscriber’s Salesforce org.</strong><br />
    All data operations—such as transformations, validations, and updates—run entirely within the subscriber’s own environment 
    (where DSP is installed) using 100% native Salesforce Apex. This ensures that data remains secure, compliant, and fully 
    contained within the Salesforce platform.
