      <strong>Match</strong> is a key step in DSP that identifies corresponding 
      records between the source and target datasets to determine how actions 
      should be applied. It is used in <strong>Insert, Update, Upsert, Merge, 
      Delete, and Undelete</strong> operations to ensure that records are 
      processed correctly.
    </p>
    <h3>How Match Works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Determines Record Matching â€”</strong>
        Identifies whether a source record has a corresponding record in the target
        object based on the <strong>Target Matching Field</strong>.
      </li>
  
      <li>
        <strong>Insert Logic â€”</strong>
        If a <strong>Target Matching Field</strong> is provided, DSP inserts a record
        <em>only if no match is found</em> in the target.  
        If <em>no Target Matching Field</em> is specified, DSP performs an
        <strong>Insert</strong> without any match check.
      </li>
  
      <li>
        <strong>Supports Multi-Field Matching â€”</strong>
        DSP allows one <strong>Target Matching Field</strong> but lets you achieve
        <strong>multi-field matching</strong> by assigning a transformation (e.g.,
        <code>VLOOKUP</code>) to that field.
      </li>
  
      <li>
        <strong>Sorting & Selection â€”</strong>
        You can sort matched records and choose whether actions apply to the
        <em>first matched record</em>
        (via the <strong>Principal Matched Record Selection Rule</strong>) or to
        <em>all matched records</em>.
      </li>
  
      <li>
        <strong>Merge-Specific Matching â€”</strong>
        During a <strong>Merge</strong>, the <strong>Principal Matched Record</strong>
        becomes the <strong>Master Record</strong>, ensuring duplicates consolidate
        correctly.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ðŸ“Œ <strong>Matching</strong> ensures accurate data operations by identifying 
      target records before applying any action, reducing duplication and 
      enhancing data integrity.
