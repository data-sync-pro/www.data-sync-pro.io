      <strong>Match</strong> is a key step in DSP that identifies corresponding 
      records between the source and target datasets to determine how actions 
      should be applied. It is used in <strong>Insert, Update, Upsert, Merge, 
      Delete, and Undelete</strong> operations to ensure that records are 
      processed correctly.

    <p>
      <strong>### How Match Works:</strong><br /><br />
      &bull; <strong>Determines Record Matching</strong> â€“ Identifies whether a 
      source record has a corresponding record in the target object based on the 
      <strong>Target Matching Field</strong>.<br />
      &bull; <strong>Insert Logic</strong> â€“ If a <strong>Target Matching Field</strong> 
      is provided, DSP inserts a record <em>only if no match is found</em> in the target. 
      If <em>no Target Matching Field is specified</em>, DSP performs an 
      <strong>Insert</strong> without checking for existing records.<br />
      &bull; <strong>Supports Mult-Fields Matching</strong> â€“ DSP allows one 
      <strong>Target Matching Field</strong> but supports <strong>multi-field matching</strong> 
      using transformations like <code>VLOOKUP</code> assigned to the 
      <strong>Target Matching Field</strong>.<br />
      &bull; <strong>Sorting &amp; Selection</strong> â€“ Enables sorting of matched 
      records and choosing whether to apply actions to the <em>first matched record</em> 
      (using the <strong>Principal Matched Record Selection Rule</strong>) or 
      <em>all matched records</em>.<br />
      &bull; <strong>Merge-Specific Matching</strong> â€“ In <strong>Merge</strong> operations, 
      the <strong>Principal Matched Record</strong> is treated as the 
      <strong>Master Record</strong>, ensuring proper consolidation of duplicate records.
    </p>
    <p>
      ðŸ“Œ <strong>Matching</strong> ensures accurate data operations by identifying 
      target records before applying any action, reducing duplication and 
      enhancing data integrity.
