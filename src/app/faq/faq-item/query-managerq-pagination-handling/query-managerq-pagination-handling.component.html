    Pagination in Query Manager (Q) is handled <strong>server-side</strong> for
    standard and custom objects, ensuring efficient querying by retrieving only
    the records needed for the current page. This <strong>optimizes performance</strong>, <strong>reduces
    memory usage</strong>, and <strong>speeds up data retrieval</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Big Objects, pagination is handled <strong>client-side</strong> because
    Salesforce does not support the <code>OFFSET</code> clause in Big Object
    queries. Instead, the <strong>full result set is fetched</strong>, and pagination is applied
    client-side. Specify the <code>LIMIT</code> to reduce the number of records
    to be queried.
