    <p>
      Pagination in <strong>Query Manager (Q)</strong> is handled server-side 
      for standard and custom objects, ensuring efficient querying by retrieving 
      only the records needed for the current page.
    </p>
    <p>
      For <strong>Big Objects</strong>, pagination is client-side because 
      Salesforce does not support the <code>OFFSET</code> clause for Big Object 
      queries. Specify a <code>LIMIT</code> to reduce the number of records 
      returned in a single query.
