    Pagination in <strong>Query Manager (Q)</strong> is handled server-side for
    standard and custom objects, ensuring efficient querying by retrieving only
    the records needed for the current page. This optimizes performance, reduces
    memory usage, and speeds up data retrieval.
  </p>
  <p>
    For <strong>Big Objects</strong>, pagination is handled client-side because
    Salesforce does not support the <code>OFFSET</code> clause in Big Object
    queries. Instead, the full result set is fetched, and pagination is applied
    client-side. Specify the <code>LIMIT</code> to reduce the number of records
    to be queried.
