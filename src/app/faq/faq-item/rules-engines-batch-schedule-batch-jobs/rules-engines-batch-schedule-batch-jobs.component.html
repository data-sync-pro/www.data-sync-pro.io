    You can schedule Batch jobs by creating <strong>Schedule</strong> records associated with 
    a <strong>Batch Executable</strong>, <strong>Pipeline</strong>, or a global Apex class implementing 
    the <code>Batchable</code> or <code>Schedulable</code> interface.

    Since Salesforce imposes limits on scheduled jobs, using Pipelines to chain Batch Executables 
    helps optimize scheduling resources and reduce job consumption.
