      To display related lists for each row in a <strong>Data List</strong>, 
      follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>1️⃣ Create a Pipeline</strong> that contains one or more 
        <strong>Data Lists</strong> configured with <strong>dynamic filters</strong> 
        based on a <strong>context record ID</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        2️⃣ In the <strong>parent Data List Executable</strong>, set the field 
        <strong>"Q: Row's Related Lists Pipeline API Name"</strong> to the 
        <strong>API Name of the Pipeline</strong> created in Step 1.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Once configured, a standard <strong>"Related Lists"</strong> row action 
      will automatically appear for each row. Clicking this action will display 
      the related lists defined in the Pipeline.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      By default, related lists open in a <strong>modal popup</strong>, but you 
      can set <strong>"Q: Show Row's Related Lists Below?"</strong> to 
      <strong>TRUE</strong> to display them inline, directly beneath the main 
      Data List.
