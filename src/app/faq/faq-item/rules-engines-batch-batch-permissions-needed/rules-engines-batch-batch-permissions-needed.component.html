      All DSP processes are structured as custom objects, meaning execution permissions depend on 
      object, field, and record access.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      To execute a Batch Executable in DSP, users <strong>must</strong> have:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>âœ… Read access to the Executable record.</li>
      <li>âœ… Create permissions on execution-related objects, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Pipeline Execution (if executed from a Pipeline).</li>
          <li>Execution and Batch Execution objects.</li>
          <li>Platform Events: Execution Result and Batch Execution Result.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p><strong>Recommended Permission Sets:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ðŸ”¹ <strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro Administrator</strong> â€“ Grants full access, including all 
        Executable records, enabling users to execute any Batch Executable. This is ideal for 
        super users or admins.
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ”¹ <strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro App User</strong> â€“ Provides necessary object and field-level 
        access without direct access to Batch Executables. To allow execution, manually share 
        specific Batch Executables with users via Salesforce's standard record-sharing mechanisms.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      ðŸš€ Using the appropriate permission set ensures users have the necessary access while 
      maintaining security and control over Batch Executions.
