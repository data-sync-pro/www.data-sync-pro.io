      In Data Loader, Input defines the data profile of 
      a CSV file, specifying how the file's columns map to fields in DSP. 
      It is used in Scoping and Field Mappings to structure the incoming 
      data before processing.

      Key Note: Unlike other rules engines where data comes from a 
      Salesforce object, in Data Loader, the Input section ensures that 
      uploaded CSV data is correctly interpreted and aligned for 
      transformation and execution.
