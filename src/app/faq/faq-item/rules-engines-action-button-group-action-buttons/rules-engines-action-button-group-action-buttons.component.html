      Grouping <strong>Executable Action Buttons</strong> into a 
      <strong>Pipeline</strong> offers several key benefits:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Centralized &amp; Organized UI</strong><br />
        The <strong>Pipeline Action Buttons</strong> component can be placed on a 
        Lightning page to present multiple buttons in a unified, streamlined 
        layout—making it easier for users to access related actions from one place.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flexible Configuration &amp; Maintenance</strong><br />
        You can <strong>add, remove, reorder, or modify</strong> Executable 
        Action Buttons directly within the Pipeline—without changing the 
        Lightning page—making updates easier to manage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Streamlined User Experience</strong><br />
        Displaying related actions together reduces UI clutter and improves 
        usability by aligning buttons with business processes in a clean, 
        consistent interface.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Pipelines bring structure, flexibility, and modularity—making 
      it easier to manage and present multiple related Action Buttons in one place.
