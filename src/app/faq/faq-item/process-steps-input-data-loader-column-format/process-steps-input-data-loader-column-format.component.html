      DSP Data Loader supports transformations by applying formulas and 
      expressions in Scoping and Field Mappings. To enable this, column 
      names in the CSV file must follow a strict format:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only English letters, numbers, and underscores are allowed.</li>
      <li>The column must start with a letter.</li>
      <li>The column cannot end with an underscore.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These requirements ensure that DSP can properly process and 
      reference columns for transformations. ðŸš€
