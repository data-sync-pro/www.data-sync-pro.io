    If a source record matches <strong> multiple target records</strong>  in the <strong> Update process</strong> ,
    DSP updates <strong>all</strong> matched records by default. However, if a
    <strong>Principal Matched Record Selection Rule</strong> is set, <strong>only</strong> the
    target record identified as the principal match based on the selected rule
    will be updated.
