  <p>Hereâ€™s how you can grant users access to a Trigger in DSP:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Access to Executables</strong>: DSP triggers are specified in
      Executables. Therefore, to grant users access to the triggers, they must
      first have access to the Executables where the triggers are defined.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Grant "DSP: Data Sync Pro Starter" Permission Set</strong> :
      Assign the "DSP: Data Sync Pro Starter" permission set to all internal
      users. This permission set provides the essential bare minimum access to
      the package objects and components needed to work with DSP triggers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Automatic Field Enablement</strong> : When enabling any trigger
      event for the first time, DSP automatically enables the "All Internal
      Users Have Read Access?" field. This creates a sharing record that grants
      all internal users read access to the current Executable. You can disable
      this checkbox at any time to revoke access for all internal users.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bypass Trigger Custom Permissions</strong> : Use the "Bypass
      Triggers Custom Permissions" field to assign specific bypass permissions
      to users, such as data migration users, who are assigned one of the
      defined custom permissions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Required Custom Permissions</strong> : Lastly, the "Required
      Custom Permissions to Execute" field allows you to specify the custom
      permissions required for users to execute the triggers defined in the
      Executable.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    These configurations offer <strong>security</strong> by ensuring that only
    authorized users can access and execute the triggers, while also providing
    <strong>flexibility</strong> to tailor access levels and permissions based
    on <strong>user personas</strong>
    or specific use cases like data migration.
