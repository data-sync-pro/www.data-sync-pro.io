    The DSP Data List is a powerful, no-code, record-based rules engine built to
    let Salesforce users retrieve, transform, and take action on Salesforce data
    in real time—all through a <strong>guided</strong>,
    <strong>configurable interface</strong>. With support for inline editing,
    dynamic filters, row and list actions, and seamless Lightning integration,
    it provides a highly interactive and user-friendly experience. Its modular
    design, declarative setup, and low-code maintenance model empower teams to
    deliver flexible, context-aware data solutions—while minimizing development
    effort and reducing tech debt.
