    The DSP Data List is a powerful, no-code, record-based rules engine built to
    let Salesforce users retrieve, transform, and take action on Salesforce data
    in real time—all through a <strong>guided</strong>,
    <strong>configurable interface</strong>. With support for inline editing,
    dynamic filters, row and list actions, and seamless Lightning integration,
    it provides a highly interactive and user-friendly experience. Its modular
    design, declarative setup, and low-code maintenance model empower teams to
    deliver flexible, context-aware data solutions—while minimizing development
    effort and reducing tech debt.

        <strong>Modular &amp; Scalable Design</strong> – Group multiple Data
      Lists into <strong>Pipelines</strong> to create guided, multi-step
      workflows that remain maintainable and reusable.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cross-Org Data Interaction</strong> – Retrieve and act on data
      across <strong>connected Salesforce orgs</strong> using
      <strong>Connection-based Executables</strong>, all within DSP.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Seamless Lightning Integration</strong> – Embed in
      <strong>Lightning Pages</strong> using tabs, stacks, or list-style views
      for a unified, interactive experience.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Enterprise-Grade Access Control</strong> – Control who can
      <strong>see and interact with each Data List</strong> and its
      <strong>defined actions</strong> based on:
      <ul>
        <li>Permission sets</li>
        <li>Custom permissions</li>
        <li>Executable sharing</li>
        <li>Target object access</li>
      </ul>
      This ensures only the right users can view, edit, or take actions—honoring
      both <strong>DSP-specific</strong> and <strong>Salesforce-native security</strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As an intuitive, no-code engine built for
    admins, developers, and business users alike, DSP Data Lists provide
    unmatched control and automation for interacting with Salesforce
    data—at scale, across orgs.
