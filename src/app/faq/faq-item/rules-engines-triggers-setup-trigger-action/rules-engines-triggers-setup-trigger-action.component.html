      Create an Executable from a Direction or Pipeline with a Template Direction, 
      ensuring that the <strong>Source connection</strong> is set to the current org. 
      Select the triggering object as the source object and choose the appropriate 
      target object. Define any matching fields, select the action type, and click 
      <strong>Save</strong> to create the Executable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, enable the triggering events that will execute the action, then configure 
      the Scoping, Match, Mapping, and Action sections as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note</em>: Ensure that <code>pushtopics.TriggerServices.execute();</code> 
      is included in your Apex Trigger with all required trigger events to enable 
      execution.
