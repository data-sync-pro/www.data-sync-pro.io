    DSP Batch is highly optimized for performance, consistently outperforming standard Apex batch jobs. 
    Actual processing speeds depend on factors like system resources and enabled automations. However, 
    with Bulk API turned on, a batch size of 2,000, and automations off or bypassed, DSP can update 
    one million records in under five minutes—demonstrating superior throughput for large-volume data.

    Enabling features such as "Skip Record Update if No Changes" can further boost performance in 
    specific scenarios, highlighting DSP Batch’s ability to handle massive datasets with 
    remarkable speed.
