    <p>
      In <strong>Data Sync Pro (DSP)</strong>, the five <strong>rules engines</strong> are distinct data processing frameworks built on a <strong>record-based configuration model</strong>, each tailored for specific types of data operations‚Äîwithin or across Salesforce orgs.
    </p>

    <h2>1Ô∏è‚É£ Batch</h2>
    <p>
      Processes large volumes of data with unmatched performance enhancement. Ideal for replacing Apex batch jobs, performing data transformations at scale, data cleansing, and migrating records between Salesforce orgs.
    </p>

    <h2>2Ô∏è‚É£ Data List</h2>
    <p>
      Renders query results as interactive, configurable tables. Enables business users to filter, explore, edit, and take action on records through list-level or row-level interactions.
    </p>

    <h2>3Ô∏è‚É£ Triggers</h2>
    <p>
      Executes rule-based automation in response to Salesforce DML events such as insert, update, delete, and undelete. Useful for real-time validations, transformations, and actions.
    </p>

    <h2>4Ô∏è‚É£ Action Button</h2>
    <p>
      Adds configurable buttons to the Lightning UI to initiate record-level or global actions. Supports pre-populated transformations, validations, and updates through guided interaction.
    </p>

    <h2>5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loader</h2>
    <p>
      Automates data uploads via CSV files using reusable configuration and transformation logic. Supports secure, trackable loading into any connected Salesforce org.
    </p>

    <h2>üìå All five rules engines share a unified architecture:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Configured through <strong>Executable records</strong></li>
      <li>
        Follow guided steps‚Äî<strong>Input</strong>, <strong>Preview</strong>, <strong>Retrieve</strong>, <strong>Scoping</strong>, <strong>Match</strong>, <strong>Mapping</strong>, <strong>Action</strong>, <strong>Verify</strong> <em>(as applicable)</em>
      </li>
      <li>Fully support <strong>cross-org operations</strong> via Connections</li>
      <li>Offer <strong>granular permissions control</strong> to manage visibility, access, and execution</li>
      <li>Built with Salesforce-native technologies (<strong>Apex</strong>, <strong>Lightning Web Components</strong>), ensuring secure, performant, and fully integrated automation inside Salesforce</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Together, these rules engines power DSP‚Äôs unified automation platform‚Äîenabling teams to design modular, flexible, and enterprise-grade data processes without the need for code.
