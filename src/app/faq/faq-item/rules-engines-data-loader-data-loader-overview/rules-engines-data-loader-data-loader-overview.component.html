      ### <strong>What is Data Loader in DSP?</strong><br /><br />
      <strong>Data Loader in DSP</strong> is a <strong>record-based rules engine</strong> 
      designed for processing <strong>CSV file uploads</strong>, applying 
      transformations, and executing actions in Salesforce. Unlike other DSP 
      rules engines that retrieve data from a Salesforce object, Data Loader 
      processes records directly from a CSV file and performs operations like 
      <strong>Insert, Update, Upsert, Delete, and more</strong> based on 
      predefined logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>### How Does Data Loader Work?</strong><br /><br />
      1Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Input Data Configuration</strong> ‚Äì Users define the structure 
      of the CSV file by specifying column names and mapping them to Salesforce fields.<br /><br />
      2Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Scoping</strong> ‚Äì Applies <strong>in-memory</strong> filtering 
      and joins to refine the uploaded data before processing.<br /><br />
      3Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Match</strong> ‚Äì Matches records in the target Salesforce object 
      using a <strong>Target Matching Field</strong>, supporting transformations 
      like VLOOKUP for multi-field matching.<br /><br />
      4Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Mapping</strong> ‚Äì Maps CSV data to target fields using DSP 
      formulas and expressions, enabling <strong>dynamic transformations</strong>.<br /><br />
      5Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Action</strong> ‚Äì Executes operations such as Insert, Update, 
      Upsert, Delete, or other configured actions.

      <strong>### Key Benefits of DSP Data Loader:</strong><br />
      ‚úÖ <strong>No-Code, Record-Based Configuration</strong> ‚Äì Set up complex data 
      transformations and automation with an intuitive, no-code approach.<br />
      ‚úÖ <strong>Reusable Executables</strong> ‚Äì Configure once and reuse multiple 
      times for efficient and consistent data processing.<br />
      ‚úÖ <strong>Comprehensive Execution Logs</strong> ‚Äì Tracks execution details 
      as <strong>data records</strong>, simplifying troubleshooting and ensuring 
      compliance.<br />
      ‚úÖ <strong>Secure Access Control</strong> ‚Äì Uses Salesforce 
      <strong>record sharing</strong> to define access, ensuring security and governance.

      üöÄ <strong>DSP Data Loader enables scalable, flexible, and secure data 
      processing with advanced transformation capabilities</strong>, reducing 
      manual effort and increasing efficiency.
