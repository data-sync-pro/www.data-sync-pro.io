    <strong>Data Loader in DSP</strong> is a
    <strong>record-based rules engine</strong> designed for processing
    <strong>CSV file uploads</strong>, applying transformations, and executing
    actions in Salesforce. Unlike other DSP rules engines that retrieve data
    from a Salesforce object, Data Loader processes records directly from a CSV
    file and performs operations like
    <strong>Insert, Update, Upsert, Delete, and more</strong> based on
    predefined logic.
  </p>
  <p><strong>How Does Data Loader Work?</strong><br /></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      1️⃣ <strong>Input Data Configuration</strong> – Users define the structure
      of the CSV file by specifying column names and mapping them to Salesforce
      fields.
    </li>
    <li>
      2️⃣ <strong>Scoping</strong> – Applies <strong>in-memory</strong> filtering
      and joins to refine the uploaded data before processing.
    </li>
    <li>
      3️⃣ <strong>Match</strong> – Matches records in the target Salesforce
      object using a <strong>Target Matching Field</strong>, supporting
      transformations like VLOOKUP for multi-field matching.
    </li>
    <li>
      4️⃣ <strong>Mapping</strong> – Maps CSV data to target fields using DSP
      formulas and expressions, enabling
      <strong>dynamic transformations</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      5️⃣ <strong>Action</strong> – Executes operations such as Insert, Update,
      Upsert, Delete, or other configured actions.
    </li>
  </ol>
