      <strong>Scoping</strong> in Data Sync Pro (DSP) refines source data 
      <strong>in-memory</strong> using <strong>filters and joins</strong> 
      to define the dataset for downstream processing. It is available 
      in all DSP rules engines, including <strong>Batch</strong>, 
      <strong>Data Lists</strong>, <strong>Triggers</strong>, 
      <strong>Action Buttons</strong>, and <strong>Data Loader</strong>.

      <strong>üîç Key Functions of Scoping:</strong><br /><br />
      &bull; <strong>Scope Filters (In-Memory Filtering)</strong> ‚Äì  
      Use DSP <strong>formulas and expressions</strong> to define precise 
      conditions for which source records should continue to Match, Mapping, 
      and Action steps.<br /><br />
      &bull; <strong>Enriching Data (Left Join or Cross Join)</strong> ‚Äì  
      Join source data with another object (from any <strong>Connection</strong>) 
      or with a <strong>JSON array</strong>, allowing 
      <strong>multi-source enrichment</strong> and dynamic filtering 
      across related datasets.
    </p>

      üìå <strong>Note:</strong> Scoping is used for 
      <strong>advanced source data refinement</strong> that cannot be handled 
      in the initial SOQL query (Retrieve). It runs <strong>after retrieval 
      or upload</strong>, but <strong>before Match, Mapping, and Actions</strong>.
