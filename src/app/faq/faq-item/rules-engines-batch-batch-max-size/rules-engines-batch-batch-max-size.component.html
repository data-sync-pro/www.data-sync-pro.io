<p>
  The maximum batch size in Data Sync Pro (DSP) is <strong>2,000
  records per batch</strong>. For <strong>remote</strong> Connections – to
  <strong>set the batch size to 2,000</strong>, <strong>"Action to Bulk API" must be
  enabled</strong>, as Salesforce’s regular API does not support DML operations with more
  than 200 records per request.
