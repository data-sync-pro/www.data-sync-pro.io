    <p>
      In the <strong>Scoping</strong> section, you can define a 
      <strong>Joiner</strong> to merge the current source data (after applying scope
       filters) with another data set. You can 
      join data from another Salesforce object within any configured Connection 
      or merge with a <strong>JSON array</strong>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Refer to the <strong>Joiner functions</strong> for examples and more details.
