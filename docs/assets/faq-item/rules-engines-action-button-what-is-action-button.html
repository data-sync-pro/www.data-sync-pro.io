      An Action Button in Data Sync Pro (DSP) is a
      no-code, record-based rules engine that enables business
      users to <strong>trigger data transformations and actions</strong> instantly
      with a single click—directly from the <strong>Salesforce Lightning UI</strong>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Each Action Button is defined in an <strong>Executable record</strong>, with
      a <strong>guided user interface</strong> that makes configuration intuitive
      and maintainable. It supports <strong>powerful transformations</strong>
      using DSP’s formula engine and allows users to
      <strong>review and edit transformed field values before execution</strong>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Supported actions include <strong>Insert, Update, Delete, Merge, Lead
      Conversion, Send Emails, Publish Platform Events, Bell Notifications</strong>,
      and more.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Action Buttons can be added to Lightning pages as
      <strong>Quick Actions</strong> or surfaced as a <strong>customizable group
      of buttons using a Lightning Web Component</strong>—empowering business
      users with real-time, rules-driven automation inside Salesforce.
