    Creating a <strong>Data List</strong> requires only an <strong>Executable record</strong> 
    and a <strong>SOQL query</strong> for the source object, which can be 
    defined using DSP's <strong>Query Manager (Q)</strong> in the 
    <strong>Retrieve</strong> section.

    building and refining SOQL queries, enabling the creation of powerful 
    Data Lists with minimal effort. Check out the
