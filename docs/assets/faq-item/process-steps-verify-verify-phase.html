      The Verify step in a Batch Executable allows you 
      to define which fields from the <strong>target object</strong> should be 
      queried and displayed for validation.

      After execution, DSP shows two data lists for each 
      <strong>Batch Execution</strong>â€”one for <strong>source records</strong> 
      and one for <strong>target records</strong>. The fields selected in 
      Verify determine which target values are shown, making 
      it easier to review outcomes and confirm that the action was applied 
      correctly.

      This step is especially useful for <strong>auditing</strong>, 
      <strong>result comparison</strong>, and <strong>post-process validation</strong>.
