      To create an <strong>Action Button</strong> in Data Sync Pro (DSP), start
      by creating an <strong>Executable</strong>—either
      <strong>Direction-based</strong> for record actions or
      <strong>Connection-based</strong> for global actions. Once created, DSP
      provides a <strong>guided interface</strong> to configure each step of the
      action logic:

    <h3><strong>Guided Steps for Defining an Action Button</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Scoping</strong> – Refine the retrieved dataset using
        in-memory filters and optional joins with other datasets for multi-source
        enrichment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Match</strong> – Identify target records using matching
        rules. Supports insert-only logic, multi-field matching via
        transformations, and merge-specific logic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mapping</strong> – Apply formulas and expressions to assign
        and transform target field values. Features auto-validation, relational
        field support, and a comprehensive function library.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Action</strong> – Define the operations to be performed,
        such as Insert, Update, Upsert, Delete, Merge, Lead Convert, Send Email,
        and more. Configure behavior options like “Skip Record Update if No
        Changes” and writeback.
      </li>
    </ol>
  
    <h3><strong>Additional Action on Target Settings:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Action on Target</strong> – Configures how the action behaves,
        including button label and style, visibility as list or row action (or
        both), confirmation prompt, and editable fields before execution.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lightning Placement Options</strong> – Action Buttons can be
        embedded as a <strong>Quick Action</strong>, a standalone
        <strong>Executable Action Button</strong>, or grouped using
        <strong>Pipeline Action Buttons</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      📌 This structured, intuitive interface ensures your Action Buttons are
      modular, reusable, and fully aligned with your business logic—without
      writing any code.
