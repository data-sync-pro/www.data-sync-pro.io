      To create an <strong>#Action Button</strong> in Data Sync Pro (DSP), start
      by creating an <strong>Executable</strong>—either
      <strong>Direction-based</strong> for record actions or
      <strong>Connection-based</strong> for global actions. Once created, DSP
      provides a <strong>guided interface</strong> to configure each step of the
      action logic:

    <h3><strong>Guided Steps for Defining an Action Button</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Scoping</strong> - Refine the retrieved dataset using
        in-memory filters and optional joins with other datasets for multi-source
        enrichment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Match</strong> - Identify target records using matching
        rules. Supports insert-only logic, multi-field matching via
        transformations, and merge-specific logic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mapping</strong> - Apply formulas and expressions to assign
        and transform target field values. Features auto-validation, relational
        field support, and a comprehensive function library.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Action</strong> - Define the operations to be performed,
        such as Insert, Update, Upsert, Delete, Merge, Lead Convert, Send Email,
        and more. Configure behavior options like “<strong>Skip Record Update if No
        Changes</strong>” and writeback.
      </li>
    </ol>
  
    <h3><strong>Additional Action on Target Settings:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Action on Target</strong> - Configures how the action behaves,
        including button label and style, visibility as list or row action (or
        both), confirmation prompt, and editable fields before execution.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lightning Placement Options</strong> - <strong>#Action Buttons </strong>can be
        embedded as a Quick Action, a standalone
        Executable Action Button, or grouped using Pipeline Action Buttons.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This structured, intuitive interface ensures your <strong>#Action Buttons </strong>are
      <strong>modular</strong>, <strong>reusable</strong>, and fully aligned with your business logic—<strong>without
      writing any code</strong>.
