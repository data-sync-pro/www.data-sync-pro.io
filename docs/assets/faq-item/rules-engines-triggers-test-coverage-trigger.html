      Salesforce requires at least <strong>one line of code</strong> in an Apex Trigger be 
      covered by an Apex test class before deployment to production.
    </p>
    <p>
      For triggers integrated with Data Sync Pro (DSP), <strong>each 
      trigger</strong> contains a single line:
    </p>
    <br />
    <code>pushtopics.TriggerServices.execute();</code>
    <br /><br />
    <p>
      To satisfy this requirement, write an Apex test that performs a DML operation 
      (such as an insert or update) on the triggering object. This will invoke the 
      trigger and ensure the line is covered.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      If the object has complex automation or dependencies, consider writing 
      dedicated Apex test classes to ensure expected behavior is fully verified.
