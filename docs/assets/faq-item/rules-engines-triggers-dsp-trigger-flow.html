    <p>
      When a record is <strong>inserted</strong>, <strong>updated</strong>, <strong>deleted</strong>, or 
      <strong>undeleted</strong> in Salesforce, DSP follows a structured execution process to enable 
      bulkified, rule-based automation:
    </p>
    <pre><code>Trigger Event Detection → Scoping → Match → Mapping → Action
  </code></pre>
    <p>
      This ensures that trigger actions and transformations are <strong>efficiently processed</strong> 
      while maintaining scalability and performance.
    </p>
