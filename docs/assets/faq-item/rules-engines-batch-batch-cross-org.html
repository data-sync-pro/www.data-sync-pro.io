  <strong>No</strong>, <strong>Batch</strong> in Data Sync Pro (DSP) is not limited to cross-org data migrations. While it 
  supports seamless cross-org data synchronization, it is also designed for high-performance 
  <strong>data operations</strong> within the same Salesforce org.

  To run batch jobs within the same org, use the Connection where "<strong>Is Current Org</strong>" is enabled, 
  allowing the job to execute in the context of the running user.
