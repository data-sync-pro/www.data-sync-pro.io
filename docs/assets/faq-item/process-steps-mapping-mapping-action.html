      Mapping in Data Sync Pro (DSP) defines how values 
      are assigned to target fields before execution. Through an intuitive, 
      no-code interface, users can apply powerful, formula-based 
      transformations to <strong>clean</strong>, <strong>enrich</strong>, and <strong>structure data</strong> at 
      <strong>scale—ensuring accuracy</strong> and <strong>consistency</strong> across operations.

    <h3><strong>Key Capabilities:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Powerful &amp; Bulkified Transformation</strong><br />
        Apply bulkified formulas using DSP's <strong>rich function library</strong> 
        with support for referencing <strong>source fields</strong> (including 
        relational fields), <strong>static values</strong>, <strong>Variables</strong> 
        (reusable formula definitions), and optional <strong>custom Apex classes</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Relationship-Aware Assignments</strong><br />
        Easily handle data relationships with support for <strong>Record Type 
        mapping via Developer Name</strong>, <strong>External ID references</strong>, 
        and <strong>VLOOKUP-based lookups</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Autocomplete &amp; Validation</strong><br />
        Benefit from <strong>real-time autocomplete hints</strong> and 
        <strong>formula validation on save</strong>, improving accuracy and ease of use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Single-Record Simplicity, Bulk Execution</strong><br />
        Define mappings as if configuring a single record—
        <strong>DSP automatically applies them at scale</strong>, handling large 
        volumes with optimized, bulkified execution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Mapping provides a scalable, low-code transformation layer that 
      <strong>balances power</strong>, <strong>flexibility</strong>, and <strong>simplicity—enabling precise</strong> control 
      over how data is prepared before it reaches its destination.
