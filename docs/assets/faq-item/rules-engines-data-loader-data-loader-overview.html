    <strong>Data Loader in DSP</strong> is a
    <strong>record-based rules engine</strong> designed for processing
    <strong>CSV file uploads</strong>, applying transformations, and executing
    actions in Salesforce. Unlike other DSP rules engines that retrieve data
    from a Salesforce object, Data Loader processes records directly from a CSV
    file and performs operations like
    <strong>Insert</strong>, <strong>Update</strong>, <strong>Upsert</strong>, <strong>Delete</strong>,
     and more</strong> based on predefined logic.
  </p>
  <p><strong>How Does Data Loader Work?</strong><br /></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Input</strong> <strong>Data Configuration</strong> – Users define the structure
      of the CSV file by specifying column names and mapping them to Salesforce
      fields.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Scoping</strong> – Applies in-memory filtering
      and joins to refine the uploaded data before processing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Match</strong> – Matches records in the target Salesforce
      object using a <strong>Target Matching Field</strong>, supporting
      transformations like VLOOKUP for multi-field matching.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mapping</strong> – Maps CSV data to target fields using DSP
      formulas and expressions, enabling dynamic transformations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Action</strong> – Executes operations such as Insert, Update,
      Upsert, Delete, or other configured actions.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Key Benefits of DSP Data Loader:</strong><br /></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
       <strong>No-Code, Record-Based Configuration</strong> – Set up complex
      data transformations and automation with an intuitive, no-code approach.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong>Reusable Executables</strong> – Configure once and reuse
      multiple times for efficient and consistent data processing.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong>Comprehensive Execution Logs</strong> – Tracks execution
      details as data records, simplifying troubleshooting and
      ensuring compliance.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong>Secure Access Control</strong> – Uses Salesforce
      record sharing to define access, ensuring security and
      governance.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    
    DSP Data Loader enables scalable, flexible, and secure data processing
      with <strong>advanced transformation capabilities</strong>, <strong>reducing manual effort</strong> and 
      <strong>increasing efficiency</strong>.
