      <strong>Serial mode</strong> should be used when processing records sequentially is necessary 
      to <strong>prevent record locking issues</strong>, <strong>ensure data integrity</strong>, 
      or <strong>maintain the correct execution order</strong>. It is particularly useful in scenarios
       where multiple records update the same parent record or when actions depend on the completion 
      of previous records.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Considerations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prevents Record Locking</strong> – Reduces the likelihood of lock
          contention, especially when updating or inserting related records.</li>
    
      <li><strong>Ensures Order of Execution</strong> – Processes records one at a
          time rather than in parallel, which is beneficial for workflows that require
          strict sequencing.</li>
    
      <li><strong>Potential Performance Impact</strong> – Since records are processed
          sequentially, execution time may increase compared to parallel processing.</li>
    
      <li><strong>Use for Dependent Transactions</strong> – Ideal when data dependencies
          exist between records that must be processed in a specific order.</li>
    </ul>    
    <p>
      Enabling serial mode ensures <strong>safer execution</strong> in these cases, 
      but it should be used selectively based on the needs of the batch process.
