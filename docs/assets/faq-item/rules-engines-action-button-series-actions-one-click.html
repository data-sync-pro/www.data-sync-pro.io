      <strong>Yes.</strong> You can implement DSP trigger actions that 
      execute multiple actions from a single record update. When the <strong>#Action Button</strong>
      updates a record that meets the triggering scope, 
      DSP Triggers can automatically fire a series of downstream actions based 
      on that update.
