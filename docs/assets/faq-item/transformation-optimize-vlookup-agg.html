      DSP improves performance through two key strategies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Lazy Loading with Caching</strong> - Queries for 
        <code>VLOOKUP</code> and <code>AGG</code> functions are executed 
        only when first evaluated. Once retrieved, results are cached and reused 
        throughout the transaction to avoid redundant lookups.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Query Consolidation</strong> - When multiple functions access 
        similar datasets, DSP intelligently merges them into a single query 
        whenever possible, reducing the number of SOQL calls and improving runtime 
        efficiency.
      </li>
    </ul>
