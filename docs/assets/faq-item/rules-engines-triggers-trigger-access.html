  <p>Hereâ€™s how you can grant users access to a Trigger in DSP:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Access to Executables</strong>: DSP triggers are specified in
      Executables. Therefore, to grant users access to the triggers, they must
      first have <strong>access to the Executables</strong> where the triggers are defined.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Grant "DSP: Data Sync Pro Starter" Permission Set</strong> :
      Assign the "DSP: Data Sync Pro Starter" permission set to <strong>all internal
      users</strong>. This permission set provides the <strong>essential bare minimum access</strong> to
      the package objects and components needed to work with DSP triggers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Automatic Field Enablement</strong> : When enabling any trigger
      event for the first time, DSP automatically enables the "<strong>All Internal
      Users Have Read Access?</strong>" field. This creates a sharing record that grants
      all internal users read access to the current Executable. You can disable
      this checkbox at any time to revoke access for all internal users.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bypass Trigger Custom Permissions</strong> : Use the "Bypass
      Triggers Custom Permissions" field to assign <strong>specific bypass permissions</strong>
      to users, such as data migration users, who are assigned one of the
      defined custom permissions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Required Custom Permissions</strong> : Lastly, the "Required
      Custom Permissions to Execute" field allows you to specify the <strong>custom
      permissions</strong> required for users to execute the triggers defined in the
      Executable.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    These configurations offer <strong>security</strong> by ensuring that only
    authorized users can access and execute the triggers, while also providing
    <strong>flexibility</strong> to tailor access levels and permissions based
    on <strong>user personas</strong>
    or specific use cases like data migration.
