      In the <strong>Field Mappings</strong> of an Executable, use <strong>functions</strong> like 
      <code>RANDOMIZE</code>, <code>RANDOM_ITEM</code>, or <code>SCRAMBLE</code> 
      to <strong>generate masked data</strong> (Note: These masking functions are only allowed in 
      a sandbox environment). You can also create custom formulas, such as 
      <code>FirstName &amp; '.' &amp; LastName &amp; '@test.com'</code>, 
      to generate obfuscated values.
    </p>

      Refer to the <strong>respective formula documentation</strong> for more details.
