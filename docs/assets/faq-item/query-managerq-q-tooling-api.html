    Yes, Q supports querying via the Tooling API. Users can switch to
    <strong>Tooling API Mode</strong> to <strong>query metadata</strong> and <strong>system-related
    objects</strong> that are not accessible through standard SOQL. This enables
    retrieving insights on Apex classes, triggers, custom fields, debug logs,
    and other Salesforce development components <strong>directly from Q</strong>.
