    <p>
      Enable "<strong>Q: Query Manager Toggleable?</strong>" on the Data List Executable 
      to give users access to the <strong>Query Manager (Q)</strong>—an intuitive UI that 
      allows them to <strong>select fields</strong>, <strong>adjust filters</strong>, and <strong>apply sorting</strong> 
      as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      DSP's Query Manager lists all <strong>selectable and orderable fields</strong>, 
      including fields from <strong>parent relationships</strong>, and provides 
      <strong>autocomplete hints</strong> for filter operators and values—tailored to 
      the field type (e.g., picklists, date/datetime, reference fields, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      📌 To simplify the interface, enable "<strong>Q: Hide Others in Query Manager?</strong> "
      to hide the "<strong>Other</strong>" section for a more focused user experience.
