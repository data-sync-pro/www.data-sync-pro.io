      <strong>Execution logs</strong> in a <strong>Data Loader</strong> process are recorded 
      as <strong>related records</strong> in DSP for detailed tracking, troubleshooting, and compliance.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Each Execution record is associated with the <strong>Data Loader 
      Executable</strong> and captures key details such as execution status, processed records, 
      errors, and timestamps. Within each execution, 
      <strong>Batch Execution records</strong> are created as related records, 
      providing granular visibility into individual batch runs.

      This structured logging approach ensures <strong>transparency</strong>, making it easy to <strong>review</strong>, 
      <strong>analyze</strong>, and <strong>troubleshoot data loads efficiently</strong>.
