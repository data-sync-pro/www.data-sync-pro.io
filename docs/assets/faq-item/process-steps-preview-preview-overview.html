      <strong>Preview </strong>functions similarly to <strong>Retrieve</strong>, as both execute a SOQL query 
      to fetch source data. However, they serve different purposes based on 
      the rules engine in use:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Retrieve </strong>is used in <strong>#Batch</strong> and 
        <strong>#Data List</strong> to define and filter the source data 
        during execution. It determines which records will be processed 
        in the operation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preview is used in <strong>#Triggers</strong> 
        and <strong>#Action Buttons</strong>, but it does not influence 
        the input data:
        <ul>
          <li>
            In <strong>#Triggers,</strong> the input data comes from the 
            triggering context (i.e., the records being inserted, updated, 
            or deleted).
          </li>
          <li>
            In <strong>#Action 
              Buttons</strong>, the input data comes from 
            the loaded record in the Lightning Record Page.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Both <strong>Retrieve </strong>and <strong>Preview </strong>allow users to <strong>view source records</strong> 
        and <strong>preview transformed values before execution</strong>, <strong>helping validate 
        the data</strong> and <strong>transformations applied</strong>.
      </li>
    </ol>
