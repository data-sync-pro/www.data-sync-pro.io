    The <strong>Batch</strong>, <strong>Data List</strong>, and <strong>Trigger</strong> rules engines in DSP are
    <strong>Direction-based</strong>, meaning they take input from a <strong>source
    object</strong>, <strong>apply transformations</strong>, and perform an <strong>action on a target object</strong>. The
    <strong>Data Loader</strong> is similar to <strong>Batch</strong> but is <strong>Connection-based</strong>, meaning its source
    data comes from a CSV upload rather than a source object. The Action Button
    can be either Direction-based or Connection-based:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Connection-based Action Button</strong> – Acts as a global action
      with no input data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Direction-based Action Button</strong> – Functions as a record
      action, using the current record from a Lightning record page as input.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    While these rules engines share similar sub-processes, the key difference
    lies in how they receive input:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Batch</strong> – Processes all records retrieved by the Retrieve
      query.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data List</strong> – Displays query results to users, allowing
      manual record selection before execution.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Triggers</strong> – Executes when Salesforce DML events occur,
      using the triggering records as input.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Action Button</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Connection-based:</strong> No input data.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Direction-based:</strong> Uses the current record from the
          Lightning record page.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data Loader</strong> – Uses uploaded CSV data as input instead of
      querying a source object.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Despite their differences in input handling, all DSP rules engines follow
    a structured process, enabling powerful automation and transformation
    capabilities.
