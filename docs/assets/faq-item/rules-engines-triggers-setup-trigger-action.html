      Create an Executable from a <strong>Direction</strong> or <strong>Pipeline</strong> with a 
      <strong>Template Direction</strong>, ensuring that the Source connection is set to the<strong>current org</strong>. 
      Select the <strong>triggering object</strong> as the <strong>source object</strong> and choose the appropriate 
      target object. Define any <strong>matching fields</strong>, select the <strong>action type</strong>, and click 
      <strong>Save</strong> to create the Executable.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Next, enable the triggering events that will execute the action, then configure 
      the <strong>Scoping</strong>, <strong>Match</strong>, <strong>Mapping</strong>, and <strong>Action</strong> sections as needed.

    <p>
      Note: Ensure that <code>pushtopics.TriggerServices.execute();</code> 
      is included in your Apex Trigger with all required trigger events to enable 
      execution.
