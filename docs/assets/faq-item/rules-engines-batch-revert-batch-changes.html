    Yes, changes made by a Batch execution can be reverted depending on the
    action type and configuration. DSP provides flexible rollback options when
    needed:

  <h3><strong>For Update Actions</strong>:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If <strong>"Log to File"</strong> is enabled, the original target data is
      saved as a <strong>JSON log file</strong> before the update.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>
      To <strong>revert updates</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use <strong>"Restore Updated From Log File"</strong> on the Batch
          Execution or Execution record.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>For Insert Actions</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      To <strong>remove inserted records</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Click <strong>"Delete Inserted Records"</strong> from <strong>the Execution
          record</strong> to delete all records inserted by the job.
        </li>
        <li>
          To delete records from a specific batch, go to the Batch Execution
          record, open the
          <strong>Verify</strong> tab, and delete directly from the data list.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>For Delete Actions</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use <strong>"Restore From Recycle Bin"</strong> if the records are still
      available there.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <strong>"Log to File"</strong> is enabled:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use <strong>"Re-Create Deleted From Log File"</strong> on the Batch
          Execution to restore deleted data from the saved log.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Reversion is <strong>not supported</strong> when
    <strong>"Action to Bulk API"</strong> is enabled.
  </p>

  <p>
    These rollback features help ensure reliable recovery from unintended
    changes—whether from updates, inserts, or deletions—supporting safer data
    operations in DSP.
