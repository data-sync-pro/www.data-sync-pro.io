    <p>
      The "<strong>Input Data Key Field</strong>" is the <strong>unique identifier</strong> for each 
      source record (case-sensitive) in DSP <strong>#Data Loader</strong>. It is used 
      internally for processing, logging, and maintaining record 
      references throughout execution.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      If not specified, DSP defaults to using the <strong>row index</strong> as the <strong>Input 
      Data Key</strong>. However, defining a key field is recommended whenever 
      possible to enhance data integrity and tracking.
