      Setting up a <strong>Data List</strong> for a <strong>remote Salesforce org</strong> is the same 
      as for a <strong>local org</strong>â€”simply ensure that the 
      <strong>source Connection</strong> points to the desired remote Salesforce org.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      This simplicity is made possible by <strong>DSP's unified Connections</strong>, 
      which treat all Salesforce orgs consistently, enabling seamless cross-org data 
      retrieval and actions with no extra setup.
