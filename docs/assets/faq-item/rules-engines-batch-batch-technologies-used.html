  Batch in Data Sync Pro (DSP) is built entirely with <strong>Apex</strong> (on the backend) and <strong>Lightning Web Components</strong> (LWC) (on the frontend), 
  ensuring secure, Salesforce-native data processing that <strong>never leaves</strong> the subscriber’s org. Unlike traditional Apex batch classes, 
  DSP’s no-code Batch uses an optimized execution framework to handle large-scale data operations faster and more efficiently.
