      <strong>Joiners in DSP</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Joiners are configured in the <strong>Scoping</strong> section to 
      <strong>combine source records with an additional dataset</strong> 
      for advanced processing. You can use one of the following functions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>JOIN_OBJECT</code> – Combines source data with another <strong>Salesforce object</strong> or <strong>Custom Setting</strong> from a configured <strong>Connection</strong>.</li>
      <li><code>JOIN_JSON</code> – Combines source data with a <strong>JSON array</strong> represented as a string.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>How It Works</strong><br />
      A Joiner operates as one of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Left Join</strong> – When <em>matching keys</em> are specified, each source record is paired with matching records from the additional dataset.</li>
      <li><strong>Cross Join</strong> – When <em>no matching keys</em> are provided, each source record is paired with <strong>every record</strong> in the additional dataset.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Referencing Joined Fields</strong><br />
      After joining, fields from the additional dataset can be referenced using:  
       <code>$Joiner.FieldName</code>
    </p><br />
    <p>
      These joined fields can be used in:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scope Filter (Post Join)</strong> – for further data refinement</li>
        <li><strong>Mapping</strong> – for applying field transformations using the joined values</li>
      </ul>
    
    <hr />
    <p>
      📌 Joiners allow you to <strong>augment source records with additional context</strong>, 
      enabling richer transformations and smarter processing—without writing code.
