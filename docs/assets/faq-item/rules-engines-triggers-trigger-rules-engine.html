      The DSP Trigger Rules Engine is a record-based, no-code automation framework 
      that executes actions based on Salesforce trigger events 
      (<strong>Before Insert</strong>, <strong>After Update</strong>, etc.). 
      Instead of writing complex Apex logic, users configure trigger-based logic 
      as <strong>Executable</strong> records, ensuring automation is modular, 
      maintainable, and bulkified.
    </p>
    <p>
      DSP Triggers operate in two ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Self-Adaptive Triggers</strong> - Transform and validate fields 
        within the same records before they are committed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trigger Actions</strong> - Use the triggering records as a source 
        to perform separate actions, such as updating related records, sending 
        notifications, or publishing platform events.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When a trigger event occurs, DSP evaluates the <em>scoping criteria</em> to 
      determine which records should be processed. It then applies field 
      transformations, validations, or actions in a bulkified manner for optimal 
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enable the Trigger Rules Engine, include the required events in your 
      Apex Trigger and call:
    </p>
    <pre><code>pushtopics.TriggerServices.execute();</code></pre>
    <p>
      This allows DSP to manage execution dynamically, ensuring flexibility, 
      scalability, and efficient automation without requiring custom Apex 
      development.
    </p>
