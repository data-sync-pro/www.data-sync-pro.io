      To avoid duplicate source records based on specific conditions, 
      use the <code>IS_FIRST_IN_ITERATION(...expressions)</code> function 
      in a <strong>Scope Filter</strong>. It evaluates whether a particular 
      combination of field values appears for the <strong>first time</strong> 
      during the current execution cycle and excludes any duplicates that follow.

    <p><strong>Example Usage</strong></p>
    <p>
      To process only one record per unique combination of 
      <strong>FirstName, LastName, and Email</strong>:<br />
      <code>IS_FIRST_IN_ITERATION(FirstName, LastName, Email)</code>
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>Note</strong></p>
    <p>
      This filter works <strong>within each</strong> <strong>batch</strong> or <strong>CSV upload</strong>, 
      not across the entire job. For better control, 
      <strong>sort the source data</strong> so that records with the same key 
      fields appear together.
      Use <code>IS_FIRST_IN_ITERATION</code> to efficiently handle 
      deduplicationâ€”without pre-processing or complex logic.
