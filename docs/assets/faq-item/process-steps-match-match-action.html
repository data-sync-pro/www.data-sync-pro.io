  <p>
    Match is a key step in DSP that identifies corresponding
    records between the source and target datasets to determine how actions
    should be applied. It is used in
    <strong>Insert</strong>, <strong>Update</strong>, <strong>Upsert</strong>, <strong>Merge</strong>, <strong>Delete</strong>
    , and <strong>Undelete</strong> operations to ensure that records are processed correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>How Match Works:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Determines Record Matching</strong> - Identifies whether a source
      record has a corresponding record in the target object based on the
      <strong>Target Matching Field</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Insert Logic</strong> - If a
      <strong>Target Matching Field</strong> is provided, DSP inserts a record
      <em>only if no match is found</em> in the target. If
      <em>no Target Matching Field is specified</em>, DSP performs an
      <strong>Insert</strong> without checking for existing records.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Supports Mult-Fields Matching</strong> - DSP allows one
      <strong>Target Matching Field</strong> but supports
      <strong>multi-field matching</strong> using transformations like
      <code>VLOOKUP</code> assigned to the
      <strong>Target Matching Field</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sorting &amp; Selection</strong> - Enables sorting of matched
      records and choosing whether to apply actions to the
      <em>first matched record</em> (using the
      <strong>Principal Matched Record Selection Rule</strong>) or
      <em>all matched records</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Merge-Specific Matching</strong> - In
      <strong>Merge</strong> operations, the
      <strong>Principal Matched Record</strong> is treated as the
      <strong>Master Record</strong>, ensuring proper consolidation of duplicate
      records.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Matching</strong> ensures accurate data operations by identifying
    target records before <strong>applying any action</strong>, <strong>reducing duplication</strong> and
    <strong>enhancing data integrity</strong>.
