        Lightning page to present multiple buttons in a unified, streamlined 
        layout—making it <strong>easier for users to access related actions from one place</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flexible Configuration &amp; Maintenance</strong><br />
        You can <strong>add, remove, reorder, or modify</strong> Executable 
        Action Buttons directly within the Pipeline—without changing the 
        Lightning page—</trong>making updates easier to manage</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Streamlined User Experience</strong><br />
        Displaying related actions together reduces UI clutter and improves 
        usability by aligning buttons with business processes in a <strong>clean</strong>, 
        <strong>consistent interface</strong>.
      </li>
    </ol>
