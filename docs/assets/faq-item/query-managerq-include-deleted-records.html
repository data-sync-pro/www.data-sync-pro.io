      Yes. To query soft-deleted records (those in the Recycle Bin), use the 
      <code>ALL ROWS</code> keyword in your SOQL query. In Query Manager(Q), 
      simply check the <em>Include Deleted</em> optionâ€”this automatically appends 
      <code>ALL ROWS</code> to your query and <strong>retrieves deleted records</strong> that are 
      still recoverable.
