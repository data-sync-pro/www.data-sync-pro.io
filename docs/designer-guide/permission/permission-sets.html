        Data Sync Pro primarily utilizes Permission Sets as a fundamental mechanism for security control. This
        approach is supplemented with Custom Permissions and Sharing Rules, allowing for granular and flexible
        management of access rights within the system. This combination ensures robust security measures are in place to
        safeguard data and control user actions effectively.
